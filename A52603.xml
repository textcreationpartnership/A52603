         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO Mr. <hi>L. MILBO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RN.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Began to read your Book, with very <hi>cloſe</hi> attention and regard; but when I had gone over ſome part of it, I perceived you were not ſo qualified, that you might (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably) undertake to intermeddle in theſe Queſtions, or deſerve to be heard concerning them. If, in defect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary Endowments of a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you pleaſe your ſelf however in the <hi>bulkineſs</hi> of your Book; you may be adviſed for the time to come, that on the contrary, every <hi>Trifle</hi> is ſo much the better, by how much the ſhorter it is; and that a <hi>verboſe</hi> Trifler is nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous even to Friends.</p>
            <p>In your Dedication you ſay, the Biſhops ought to uſe <hi>a juſt Severity againſt,</hi> and to <hi>frown effectually</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch, whom the late Act of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration excludes from all Benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: that is, they ought to fall to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Socinians, for the (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) Errors of their Conſcience. Truly <hi>(Sir)</hi> we are beholden to you. But what if the Socinians, againſt whom you <hi>publickly</hi> excite the Biſhops, ſhould write the <hi>Farce</hi> of your Life? They know very well the ſeveral <hi>Scenes</hi> of it, and the <hi>Part</hi> you have acted at <hi>Pembr.</hi> Hall, at <hi>London,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> from whence 'tis ſaid <hi>you ran away:</hi> Are you not aware, that it were eaſy for them to make you a Town-talk; as you have made your ſelf a Country-talk, and at beſt withdrew your ſelf? Your <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> has two Parts; The Firſt is an Apology for your Book; the other is taken up in conplementing <hi>T. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will ſpeak briefly to both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That you have ſaid <hi>but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in a great deal,</hi> that the Parts of your Book are <hi>ill put together,</hi> that you have been <hi>impertinent</hi> in divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Matters, that were beſide your Text and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking; all theſe you confeſs: but you excuſe the Meanneſs
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:110211:3"/>of your Performance by your Poverty, and your Poverty you lay to the Charge of the People of <hi>Yarmouth;</hi> who could not, you ſay, be made ſenſible of your Learning and Worth; that is <hi>the meaning</hi> of what you have ſaid at <hi>Pag. 1.</hi> of your <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuch as know <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> how populous and wealthy it is, will not be perſwaded out of it, but that a Perſon of no more Learning or Parts than <hi>L. M.</hi> were he withal but <hi>Modeſt, Peaceable,</hi> and <hi>Exemplary,</hi> might live at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in quality of their Miniſter, very handſomly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and beſides be eſteem'd and belov'd. They tell us, that ſeeing your Sermons againſt us, have been ſo little liked at their Majeſty's <hi>good Town</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth;</hi> we ought to make trial, how that <hi>diſcerning</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will entertain our Pamphlets; they have already <hi>refuſed the Evil,</hi> there is therefore reaſonable hope, that they will <hi>chuſe</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> and will rejoice in it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Part of your <hi>Preface</hi> is all Complement on <hi>T. F.</hi> Thus you begin, calling him, <hi>pert Smatterer in Ignorance:</hi> ſo ſays the <hi>Reverend</hi> Mr. <hi>L. M.</hi> and this was the <hi>beſt</hi> he could ſay, when he undertook to give a Character of <hi>T. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> find that the <hi>moſt Reverend</hi> are in a very different Story concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Gentleman: The Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of all <hi>England,</hi> thought fit to ſay of him, <hi>That Worthy and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Citizen, Mr.</hi> T. F. <hi>Fun. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on Mr.</hi> Gouge, <hi>p. 63.</hi> What may be the Reaſon that <hi>T. F.</hi> is drawn in ſuch different Colours? I think 'tis not hard to find the Reaſon: Some, becauſe they heartily love God, and reverence Vertue and Well-doing, can think and ſpeak reſpectfully, even of thoſe from whom they differ very wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Sentiments about the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted</hi> Points of Chriſtianity: for God's ſake they can cordially ſmile upon a good Man, though they think him in an Error; and they are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe the Holy Scriptures have ſaid it, that fervent <hi>Charity</hi> is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Faith.</hi> But others, meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Perſons and Things, by only the narrow Intereſts of <hi>themſelves</hi> and their <hi>Party,</hi> and wholly exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and the relation to him, rail againſt their Adverſaries, giving all Men to the Devil that are of a Belief contrary to theirs. Which brings to mind what Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> has obſerved: <q>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quiſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> eorum pro ventre eſt max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imè ſollicitus, ita pro fide ſuâ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenditur Bellator acerrimus: <hi>i. e. As any of them are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and afraid for their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; ſo he is found to bawl and rail loudeſt, on behalf of his own particular Faith and Party.</hi>
               </q> Calv. Praef. ad Inſtitut. <hi>p. 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but what might be the very meaning of this Witticiſm on <hi>T. F. pert Smatterer in Ignorance?</hi> I ſuppoſe the meaning is, <hi>T. F.</hi> has had his Education at <hi>London,</hi> not at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg</hi> or <hi>Oxford;</hi> he knows nothing
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:110211:3"/>of <hi>Predicables, Predicaments</hi> and <hi>Syllogiſms;</hi> nor has ever learned <hi>there</hi> to drink the third or fourth Bottle for his own ſhare. What an unhappy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation was this, that his Friends took no care to make him a <hi>Fool</hi> and a <hi>Debauch;</hi> that the Gifts and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of God and Nature, have not been effaced by a ſort of Inſtitution, which ſometimes to make a <hi>Scholar,</hi> defaces both the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? T. F.</hi> has only <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>good Senſe;</hi> how unlucky was it, that he ſhould not deſtroy them by Logick and Metaphyſicks? However, I am of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>T. F.</hi> will make his natural Talents go as far, and do him as much Service and Credit, as Logick and Metaphyſicks, and skill of the Bottle, will do for <hi>L. M.</hi> or for his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The next Charge upon him, is in theſe words; <hi>The Socinians Hawker, to diſperſe their new-fangled Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi> Hawker! of all Men living, <hi>L. M.</hi> ſhould have forbore this word Hawker; unleſs he has forgot, becauſe 'tis a good while ſince, how unluckily the hawking off Books ſucceeded with himſelf, in a certain place which at preſent I forbear to name. See, Sir, we can be affronted and abuſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making haſte to revenge our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But why is our Divinity <hi>new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled?</hi> It hath two ſuch Marks of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> by confeſſion of our very Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, that could they ſhow either of them for their Divinity, we would make little difficulty of coming over to their Party. For, firſt, 'tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the moſt Learned of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, that the <hi>Patriarchal Ages,</hi> and the Church of the Old Teſtament, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew the Doctrine of the Trinity: We are confeſs'd (by our Adverſaries) to believe concerning God, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Prophets believed; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is <hi>but one who is God,</hi> or that <hi>God is but one Perſon.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Apoſtles Creed, the only Monument of true Antiquity, beſides the Bible, which the Chriſtian Church has, is owned (too) to be wholly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; for it gives the Appellation <hi>God,</hi> to only the Almighty Father, Maker of Heaven and Earth: and ſpeaks of our Saviour under no other Characters, but thoſe of a <hi>Man,</hi> deſcribing his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Generation (by the Holy Ghoſt, or <hi>Power of God</hi>) in the Womb of Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> declaring that he <hi>died,</hi> was <hi>buried, roſe again,</hi> and <hi>was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted</hi> to the right Hand of God, <hi>that is,</hi> to be next unto God; all which is <hi>a denying him to be God.</hi> It ſays no more of the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghoſt, than it ſays of the <hi>Holy</hi> Catholick Church: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>in</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, I believe <hi>in</hi> the Holy Catholick Church; ſo (all know) this Creed is read in the Original Greek.</p>
            <p>Your laſt fling at <hi>T. F.</hi> is to this purpoſe, tho after a ſcurrilous faſhion; that <hi>the Socinians</hi> have made choice of him, to diſperſe their Pamphlets; <hi>That a Perſon ſo much concerned and imployed in the diſpoſal of Charity, might keep the Ballance even, between Heaven and Hell; and while he ſupports Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:110211:4"/>might pervert and poiſon their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis well, Sir; but what will your <hi>Wiſdomſhip</hi> adviſe in the caſe? Shall we turn this <hi>dangerous</hi> Man out of the gainful Imployment of neglecting his own Buſineſs, and loſing his Time, to be an Inſtrument of Good to the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Neceſſitous?</hi> And let me ask you this Queſtion, Do you really think, that this Gentleman ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to proſelyte to his particular Perſwaſion any of <hi>the Objects of Charity,</hi> with whom he is concerned? Does he, think you, ſeek to <hi>gather a Church</hi> out of the Hoſpitals, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Corners of Streets, or of ſuch Perſons as are ready to periſh for want of Bread or Clothes? If you your ſelf do not ſo think, as you are challenged, to give but one ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what you would inſinuate: to your Head <hi>you are an ill Man,</hi> to make that the ſubject of your Scurrility, which ſhould have been of your Praiſes and Commendations. Doth the Age, Sir, ſo abound with Men, who make it any part of their buſineſs to <hi>miniſter to the Wants of others,</hi> that it ſhould be adviſable to diſcourage ſuch Perſons, by falſe and ſcandalous Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo's? But I am with-held by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Charge, as I am told, from him, from doing him that Right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Reproaches, which I thought to be due to his Exemplary Induſtry, and particular Dexterity in ſolliciting and managing the Cauſe and Intereſts of the Poor: He ſaith, if what he doth in that matter will not defend it ſelf, he is content to be without a Defence.</p>
            <p>You conclude with <hi>ſubmitting ALL that you have written to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Correction of Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I acknowledg the Language of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> but was it convenient, that <hi>a Presbyter of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (as you write your ſelf) ſhould thus publiſh to the whole World, that he has neither <hi>Faith</hi> nor <hi>Religion;</hi> I mean of his own, but only what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-<hi>Church</hi> ſhall preſcribe to him, as the terms of Preferment? He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds here in a Book of <hi>800</hi> Pages, the Doctrines of the Trinity and the Satisfaction, as <hi>Eſſential</hi> Articles of the Chriſtian Religion; and ſuch as muſt be believed, or (if you'll believe him) you ſhall <hi>without doubt periſh everlaſtingly:</hi> He pretends he has proved theſe Doctrines by <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Reaſon, and by <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of Holy Scripture, and of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Well, does he himſelf believe what he has written? Not a Tittle of it, he ſays, unleſs Mother-<hi>Church</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it; he ſubmits ALL, Faith and Proofs, to <hi>the Cenſure</hi> and Correction of his Holy Mother; let her hang or ſave, he ſubmits.</p>
            <p>This is the Man with whom we have to deal, without Faith and without Conſcience, unleſs as the Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects; nay, and he dares profeſs too, to be otherwiſe without either. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>L. M.</hi> alone, but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others that believe their Paradoxes
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:110211:4"/>no more than we do, but they ſubdue firſt their Conſciences, and afterwards their Minds to the Sophiſtries uſually alledged to prove them, ſo long as Holy Mother Church (which can diſpoſe of their Fortunes in the World) recommends this Belief as the condition of holding a Parſonage or Vicarage, or of getting a Deanary or Prebend. On the ſame Conditions Mother <hi>Shipton</hi> ſhould be as ſacred and infallible with them as Mother <hi>Church;</hi> and they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Kingdom of <hi>Oberon,</hi> and the Territories of <hi>Fairy-Land:</hi> and had they been born Papiſts, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation ſhould have been reckoned among the holy <hi>Myſteries,</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> muſt imbrace, tho <hi>Reaſon</hi> (craz'd they ſay, ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims and renounces them.</p>
            <p>But who is <hi>Holy Mother-Church</hi> to whom they pay ſuch Profound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions? I meet with her in Story ſome hundreds of Years paſt; ſhe ſeems to be ſuch a one as the Scots imagin'd Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be: I mean, as <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>vivacious.</hi> The Scots thought their King ſhould never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> for Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſay they, is not a particular Woman: But the Lords of the Council in <hi>England</hi> call an old Woman Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and ſo long as there is an old Woman in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they will never want a Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the worſt thing, to my Fancy, in Holy Mother-Church, is this, that ſhe is ſuch an <hi>Individuum Vagum;</hi> in one place ſhe is this thing, in another ſhe is the juſt contrary: ſhe is not the ſame in <hi>England</hi> (for inſtance) that ſhe is at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the two Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or in the Provinces of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> in all theſe places ſhe is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent a Perſon, that ſhe <hi>mortally</hi> hates and <hi>furiouſly</hi> perſecutes her own ſelf.</p>
            <p>I find juſt ſuch another Fantaſm haunting the <hi>choſen</hi> Nation, as is now meant by Mother-<hi>Church;</hi> and it was in as much regard with two ſorts of People, the Deſigning and the Weak, as Mother-<hi>Church</hi> is now with the like ſorts of Men and Women. <hi>Jer. 7.4. Truſt not in vain words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> By which they intended what ſome now do, when they ſay <hi>Mother-Church, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church, Mother-Church;</hi> but the Prophet ventures to call them <hi>vain words, i. e.</hi> a lying and unprofitable Pretence.</p>
            <p>But after all that Reverence which any pretend to have for this <hi>Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> 'tis certain there is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant by <hi>our Holy Mother the Church,</hi> but only <hi>the ſtrongeſt ſide,</hi> or the prevailing Party. And all the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Complements Men uſe to this bleſſed Mother, are nothing elſe but their <hi>Wit</hi> or their <hi>Fears.</hi> They find themſelves the Slaves of an uſurping Faction in the Church, which is able to conſtrain them to profeſs any thing, tho never
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:110211:5"/>ſo contradictory and abſurd: therefore the <hi>Witty</hi> preſently liſt themſelves of the Party, call themſelves her <hi>Sons</hi> and Children and <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>ſwear</hi> to all ſhe propounds. In others, their Dread and Awe turns into real Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or rather Superſtition; and they act and believe as they are commanded, without deſiring or caring to reflect upon the Cauſes which firſt <hi>biaſſed</hi> their Minds to this Obedience; but thoſe Cauſes were originally nothing elſe, but the Power and Wealth of the Holy Mother, that is (as was ſaid) <hi>of the ſtrongeſt ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is another ſort of People, called Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, who having free and diſcerning Minds, ſtout and brave Souls, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (in ſome Particulars) either <hi>cheated</hi> or <hi>wronged</hi> by the ſtrongeſt ſide; they maintain, tho a dangerous and bazardous, yet a generous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual War, for the Natural Liberties of Mankind in Matters of Conſcience and Religion. They aſſert by all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (and honeſt) means, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> that is, they admit of no Lords over Conſcience, but only God; nor any Law of Faith, of Worſhip or Manners, but only God's Word; no Canons or Articles, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly deviſed Creeds or Catechiſms, nothing but God's Word, <hi>the naked Goſpel,</hi> without any Interpretations or Interpreters, but only <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Good Senſe.</hi> Theſe have the luck ſometimes to baffle <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> and to bear up againſt all her Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOUR (particular) Friend Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> has begun his Attack on Socinianiſm, with a Text of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> in the Explication and Vindication of which, he waſtes no fewer than 82 Pages; The Text is this, <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. He ſaith hereupon, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome <hi>Tranſlators</hi> read here, <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, WHICH</hi> (which My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery) <hi>was manifeſted by Fleſh:</hi> that is, the <hi>Law</hi> was given by <hi>Angels,</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> by the Miniſtry of <hi>Men,</hi> (even by Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles) called <hi>Fleſh</hi> here, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Angels who are <hi>Spirit;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Fleſh</hi> is the uſual Scripture-Term for <hi>Man:</hi> but all the <hi>Greek Copies</hi> (he ſaith) agree in reading this Text, as we read it in our Engliſh Bibles; as alſo does the famous <hi>Manuſcript</hi> in the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Library, which is about 1300 Years old.</p>
               <p>And if (ſaith he) the Providence of God, as the Socinians contend, is concerned to preſerve his own holy Word from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Falſifications; 'tis reaſonable to think, ſuch Providence has been exerciſed rather about the <hi>Original Greek,</hi> than about <hi>Tranſlations.</hi> But neither, ſaith he, do all the <hi>old</hi> Tranſlations read here, as the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians do; for the <hi>Arabick</hi> reads as we do, <hi>GOD was manifeſted in the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further more, <hi>Macedonius,</hi> to whom the Socinians impute the Corruption of this Text, was too late in time; for he lived in the Year 512. to attempt an Innovation in Scripture: And beſides, he could have no deſign in ſo doing; becauſe he had no <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> Opinions about our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Finally, the word <hi>God</hi> in the firſt Clauſe of this Verſe, makes that Clauſe to accord with all that follow it; for all of them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110211:6"/>together will make this moſt proper Senſe. <q>The Eternal Son of God, God equal with his Father, and Creator of the World, took upon him, and was <hi>manifeſted</hi> in our weak and paſſible Nature, being incarnate in the Man Chriſt Jeſus: He was <hi>juſtified</hi> to be God, notwithſtanding his mean outward Appearance, by divers glorious Actions and Miracles, done on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half by the Holy Spirit: He was <hi>ſeen</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> known) <hi>by Angels,</hi> to be the Eternal Son of God, and God, thô covered with the Veil of Fleſh: He was <hi>preached</hi> as ſuch, by the Apoſtles <hi>to the Gentiles;</hi> was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on</hi> generally in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came: and after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on He was <hi>received up</hi> into the Glories of Heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But if, ſaith our Author, we read here, as the Socinians do; <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, WHICH Myſtery was manifeſted by Fleſh,</hi> that is, <hi>by Men;</hi> what Senſe ſhall we make of the other Clauſes? Will it be Senſe to ſay, The Myſtery of Godlineſs (the Goſpel) was <hi>ſeen by Angels?</hi> Or will it be true, that it was <hi>received up into the Glory</hi> of Heaven? The Socinians indeed here anſwer, That inſtead of theſe words, <hi>received up into Glory,</hi> it ſhould have been ſaid by our Tranſlators, <hi>was gloriouſly extolled,</hi> was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and lifted up: but this, ſaith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, is falſe; for on the contrary, the Goſpel was deſpiſed and derided both by Jews and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>This is the Sum and Force of what he has tranſcribed out of Authors, in behalf of his Opinion, from the words of this Text. He might, if he had pleaſed, have given us too the full and ſolid Anſwer, made by the Socinians, to theſe Pretences of his Party: for I ſee, he has quoted the Books, in which thoſe Anſwers are to be found: but that was not the way, he thought, to mend his Fortunes in the World; which is what he aims at, and the cauſe of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Book.</p>
               <p>I will (briefly) evince theſe two things. 1. This Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> has been <hi>falſified</hi> by thoſe, who affirm the Ante-mundan Exiſtence, and Divinity of our Saviour. 2. This Corruption has been ſo unskilfully performed, that the Attempt ſerves, only to betray their Unfaithfulneſs and Partiality, but does not a whit avail their Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Text, has been moſt certainly falſified, by ſubſtitution of the word <hi>God,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Which, WHICH (Myſtery) was manifeſted by Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt time I meet with this Text, read with the word <hi>God,</hi> among the Antients, is in the Acts of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> a Council of next Authority to the Scriptures themſelves, in the Opinion of our Oppoſers. In this Council, a Perſon repeated the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as they are now read by Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians; <hi>God was manifeſted in Fleſh:</hi> the Perſon who made this Miſtake, probably from ſome <hi>Marginal Note,</hi> where he found the word <hi>God</hi> put as an Explanation of the word <hi>Which</hi> in the Text, was anſwered by <hi>Macarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the reading, for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words are, <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, WHICH was manifeſted by Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> will not ſay, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Old</hi> Tranſlations, the Latin, Syriac and Armenian, were Unitarians; be ſure St. <hi>Jerom</hi> (Author of the Latin) was a bigotted Trinitarian: yet they and he read with the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, <hi>WHICH was manifeſted by Fleſh,</hi> not <hi>GOD was manifeſted in Fleſh.</hi> I appeal to any Man, of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſe, whether he can think, thoſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators and Fathers would have corrupted the Bible in favour, and to the advantage of their Adverſaries the Unitarians, by ſaying (not <hi>GOD,</hi> but) <hi>WHICH</hi> was manifeſted by Fleſh: and whether their ſo tranſlating <hi>(WHICH was manifeſted by Fleſh)</hi> be not a Demonſtrative Proof, that the Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of thoſe ancient Times did read, as the Socinians now do?</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, the <hi>Arabic</hi> Verſion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is on his ſide. I am not now in a place, where I have many Books; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly none of the <hi>Polyglots;</hi> but I ſee, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110211:6"/>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> and other Criticks (in Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Collection) do all allow, that the <hi>Arabic</hi> reads here, as the Syriac and Latin do, <hi>WHICH was manifeſted by Fleſh.</hi> Therefore I ſuppoſe, that our Author makes uſe of a <hi>Polyglot</hi> that has been conformed (<hi>i. e.</hi> corrupted) by the Publiſhers, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Greek Editions: for not only the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, but the Syriac and Latin have been ſo uſed in divers places, by later Publiſhers; as Father <hi>Simon</hi> often obſerves. Beſides, the queſtion is, concerning the <hi>Old</hi> Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made before Trinitarians were become abſolute Maſters of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> ſuch as the Latin, Armenian and Syriac: the Arabic is much later; all the Arabic Verſions having been made, but only ſince the Conqueſt of the Eaſtern Provinces by the Turks. F. <hi>Simon</hi> Crit. Hiſt. on the Old Teſt. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 109, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Tis by the Trinitarians themſelves, that we are informed of divers Editions of the Greek Copies; in which the Publiſhers have <hi>corruptly,</hi> ſay they themſelves, put <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Which</hi> in this Text. Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> (in <hi>lib.</hi>) cites <hi>Hincmarus,</hi> confeſſing, that the Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Trinitarians corruptly ſubſtituted <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Which</hi> in theſe words of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> ſo much the better to defend themſelves againſt the Eutychians. And <hi>Liberatus</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>Macedonius</hi> (Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) was depoſed in a Council ſummoned by the Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius, Anno</hi> 512. for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Greek Edition of the Bible, in which he corrupted this Text, by cauſing all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers to write <hi>God</hi> in the place of <hi>Which.</hi> Of theſe two Authors, <hi>Hincmarus</hi> was a Perſon of great Dignity, being Archbiſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and (by Confeſſion of our Oppoſers) not only altogether Orthodox, but very Learned and Pious: the other, <hi>Liberatus,</hi> was Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and beſides the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Orthodox and Learned, was alſo contemporary to the matter of which he writes, the Depoſition of <hi>Macedonius</hi> for corrupting this Text.</p>
               <p>What now does Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> oppoſe to theſe <hi>Authentick</hi> Hiſtories? He oppoſes only <hi>two</hi> ſilly <hi>Conjectures.</hi> He ſaith, he doth not think, <hi>Macedonius</hi> would attempt ſuch a thing; becauſe he had no peculiar Opinions of his own about our Saviour; and becauſe he ſeems too late in Time, to hope reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably that the Forgery could paſs unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>But does not Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> know, that <hi>this Macedonius</hi> was a Trinitarian? Do not all the Church-Hiſtorians call him <hi>Orthodox?</hi> And was not this cauſe enough, with an ill Man, as the Council judged him to be, to adventure on ſuch an Undertaking? Nor was this Corruption <hi>ſo late in Time,</hi> but that it has been the cauſe, that many Publiſhers have followed his Copies; and his pretence (without doubt) was, that he found the word <hi>God</hi> in the Margins of ſome Bibles, which he took to be a Correction, not an Explication (as indeed it was) of the word <hi>Which</hi> in the Body of the Text.</p>
               <p>But here, Sir, you your ſelf will perhaps object, that theſe Corruptions being thus noted by Learned Men, and even by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, would not have been followed by all the Copiers and Publiſhers of the Bible: but we ſee, ſo Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> ſays, that all the Greek Copies, eſpecially the famous one in the King's Library (about 1300 Years old, and therefore <hi>older than Macedonius</hi>) read here, <hi>GOD was manifeſted in the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this, I ſay, I believe all the Greek Copies that Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> has ſeen, may ſo read; for he has ſeen ('tis likely) ſome <hi>one;</hi> but he ought to have conſulted Learned Men, before he was ſo confident, that all (abſolutely All) Greek Copies read as 'tis in his Book. <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> ſomewhat learneder than our Author, ſays, <hi>Multa vetera exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaria, i. e.</hi> a great many of the ancient Copies read, <hi>WHICH was manifeſted by Fleſh:</hi> and ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi> further, <hi>I approve of that reading.</hi> Our Author may ſee theſe words of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Collection of Criticks in <hi>L.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> had look'd into the Margin of <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> his moſt correct Edition of the Greek Teſtament, he would have ſeen there, that the ancient Greek Copies uſed by that Critick, read <hi>WHICH
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110211:7"/>was manifeſted by Fleſh:</hi> and ſo alſo <hi>Morinus,</hi> another famous Critick, acknowledges.</p>
               <p>I know not how old the Copy in the King's Library may be, Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, that 'tis about 1300 Years old, and older than <hi>Macedonius:</hi> when his hand was in, he might have ſaid, 'tis now preciſely 1592. Years old; and is the very Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphal Copy of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt; he may ſay ſo, if he pleaſes; for the Book has no Date, nor any certain Circumſtance, by which we may judg 'tis 1300 Years old, rather than 1000 or 1100, and therefore <hi>younger than Macedonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Author ſays, we cannot make <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the other Clauſes in this Verſe; if we read this <hi>governing</hi> Clauſe by, <hi>WHICH was manifeſted by Fleſh;</hi> for how was this <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the Goſpel <hi>ſeen by Angels,</hi> and how was it <hi>received up into Glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is a forward Man at cenſuring, but he ſhould have had more Manners, when the Writers of Holy Scripture were concerned. We affirm, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth here ſay, the Myſtery of the Goſpel was <hi>ſeen by Angels:</hi> Why ſhould not this be <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Senſe;</hi> when another Apoſtle hath expreſly told us, that <hi>the Angels deſire to look into it?</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of <hi>received up into Glory,</hi> he knows, that we tranſlate by <hi>was received gloriouſly,</hi> was magnified, extolled, lifted up. But tho he dares not deny, that the original words are capable of this Tranſlation, he finds fault with it as a falſe <hi>Senſe;</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) on the contrary, the Goſpel was derided and deſpiſed, both by the Jews and Gentiles. We deny not, that <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>intereſſed</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both of the Jews and Gentiles, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Goſpel: but we certainly know, it was ſo received in moſt places, if not in all; that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had reaſon here to ſay, it was gloriouſly entertained and magnified. Himſelf tells us, that having preached the Myſtery of the Goſpel, to the Galatian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they were ſo affected with it, that <hi>they would have given to him their very Eyes; Gal.</hi> 4.15. St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, witneſſes that <hi>throughout all</hi> Aſia, <hi>the Name of the Lord Jeſus was magnified;</hi> Acts 19.10, 17. As concerning the Jews, 'tis ſaid of them, at <hi>Acts</hi> 21.20. that <hi>many thouſands</hi> (in the Greek 'tis many ten thouſands) <hi>of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:</hi> and what is more marvellous, at Acts 6.7. <hi>A great Company</hi> (even) <hi>of the Prieſts were obedient to the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Author therefore might have ſpared his falſe and impious Scurrility upon the Goſpel, when he ſaith at <hi>Pag.</hi> 68. <hi>It was ſcorned and derided, both by Jews and Gentiles.</hi> Had he no way to defend his Cauſe, but by an Inſult on the Goſpel it ſelf?</p>
               <p>I know not, Sir, what ſtronger or clearer Proofs any Man can require, that this Text was anciently read, by <hi>WHICH</hi> (which Myſtery of Godlineſs) <hi>was manifeſted by Fleſh: i. e.</hi> by <hi>Man,</hi> as the Law had been by Angels? For you ſee, we have for this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>firſt</hi> all the ancient Tranſlations, the Latin, Armenian and Syriac; <hi>then</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſo much extolled and reverenced by our Oppoſers: beſides theſe, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Trinitarian Hiſtorians, Men of Learning and Dignity, and contemporary to the Corruption of this Text; alſo a vaſt number of the beſt and oldeſt Copies of the Original Greek, and the Judgment of the ableſt Criticks upon them.</p>
               <p>If all this does not amount to a <hi>Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> on our ſide, in the Judgment of indifferent Perſons; yet there is no Man of common Prudence and Caution, but will allow, that the reading for which our Adverſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <hi>(GOD was manifeſted in Fleſh)</hi> is too uncertain, doubtful and precarious, to build on it (as the Trinitarians do) an Article of Faith; or to innovate in the Doctrine of the Unity of God, dictated to us by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, and <hi>the principal Deſign of both the Teſtaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſing now this Point were yielded to them, that we are to read here, <hi>GOD</hi> was manifeſted in (or <hi>by</hi>) Fleſh; it will nothing avail the Trinitarian Cauſe. For by <hi>GOD</hi> here we may underſtand, as in divers other Texts the Trinitarians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110211:7"/>do, not <hi>the Perſon,</hi> but <hi>the Will</hi> and Mind of God: this was manifeſted to us by Fleſh, that is, by <hi>Men,</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, our Tranſlators render the words by, <hi>was manifeſted IN Fleſh;</hi> but they will not deny, that they might have been rendred, <hi>Manifeſted BY Fleſh:</hi> for themſelves ſo <hi>interpret</hi> the Greek Particle, in the very next Clauſe of this Verſe, <hi>was juſtified IN the Spirit;</hi> that is, ſay They, was Juſtified (or Proved) <hi>by</hi> the Spirit, by Miracles done by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>That the word <hi>God</hi> may be ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, not of <hi>the Perſon,</hi> but of <hi>the Will</hi> or Mind of God; is not denied by the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Interpreters; nay themſelves, as I ſaid before, ſo interpret. Thus, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Do I now perſwade Men, or God?</hi> Our Oppoſers interpret it, thus; Do I ſeek to perſwade <hi>Human</hi> Inventions, the Devices and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Men,</hi> or the very <hi>Will and Commands of God?</hi> The like on divers other Texts.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Sir, if Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> has prevailed with you, to read this firſt Clauſe by, <hi>God was manifeſted;</hi> you may for all that, abide in your Sentiment about the Unity of God; and interpret to him the whole Verſe, after this manner.</p>

                  <q>Without Controverſy, Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, even the Goſpel of the Bleſſed Jeſus; for 'tis no leſs or other, than the Will and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God manifeſted to us, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and ſutable Miniſtry of <hi>Men,</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and Blood like to our ſelves: not as <hi>the Law</hi> was, by the Amazing and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance of Flaming Miniſters, even the <hi>Spirits</hi> and Angels of Heaven.

               <p>From <hi>P.</hi> 82. where our Author takes leave of this famous Text, to <hi>P.</hi> 309. He mortifies his Reader, with a long Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, concerning the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of Myſteries, in Religion: and that, 'twas Neceſſary the Meſſias ſhould be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>We are not concerned, in the Truth or Falſhood of either of theſe Affirmations of our Author: be it, as He ſays; thô his Allegations (or any He can bring) prove neither of them; What are they to his Purpoſe?</p>
               <p>If Myſteries are indeed ſo uſeful in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as he contends they are; it will not follow from thence, that we muſt admit, as parts of our Religion, all the Myſteries that fanciful or ignorant Men have deviſed; much leſs that we are obliged, to let all the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>Contradictions,</hi> that Any may ſeek to impoſe on our Faith, paſs for <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Myſteries.</p>
               <p>That 'twas <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> that the Meſſias ſhould be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> I doubt very much; and I think, our Author has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd nothing in proof of it, that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable or Material: but that <hi>de Facto</hi> it was ſo, that our Lord Chriſt was indeed the Son of God, the Socinians have always Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Affirmed; becauſe he was begotten by the Divine Power on a pure Virgin.</p>
               <p>Therefore overpaſſing ſo much uſeleſs. Scrible of this Author, I come to his <hi>ſecond Particular</hi> (as He calls it) at <hi>P.</hi> 309.

               <p>THAT our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was true God, Equal with his Father; our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor undertakes to prove, 1. From Texts of the Old Teſtament. 2.

                  <p>He alledges, Firſt, the Hiſtory of the <hi>Three</hi> Angels, who at <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. appeared to <hi>Abraham.</hi> One of theſe Angels is called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> both by <hi>Abraham</hi> and by the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: but the Name Jehovah (which our Tranſlators render LORD) is, ſaith our Author, communicable only to God; and that this Angel was indeed God, appears f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rther by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s calling him (at <hi>V.</hi> 18.) <hi>the Judg of the whole Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith hereupon; that by this Hiſtory we gain the Certainty, that our Saviour had a Being before he was born of the Virgin: and that the Title, Power and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, belonging to the True God, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But all this while, Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> you forget <hi>the one thing Neceſſary;</hi> even to prove to us that this Angel, or this Jehovah, is the ſame Perſon that afterwards (in Goſpel-times) is called the Lord Jeſus. When you evince that, your Allegation of this Hiſtory, will indeed be a Proof of the <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> of our Saviour: till then, we remain in that (ſeemingly) rational Belief, that <hi>his Mother was Older than He.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But neither can we grant to you, that this Angel was indeed God; becauſe the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is given to him: for that Name is beſtowed (in Holy Scripture) on Angels, when they are appointed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Perſon of God; as we ſhall (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently) ſee is confeſſed, by ſome of the principal Critics of the Trinitarians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all the Jewiſh Interpreters. Nay, the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is given to ſuch <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> as well as Perſons; as God has honoured with his Preſence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But He obſerves, that the Angel here is called <hi>the Judg of the whole E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>th;</hi> therefore He could be no other than God.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>firſt,</hi> he might have noted too, that there is an Ambiguity in the Original Words; for they might have been rendred, <hi>the Judg of a whole Land:</hi> So that the Senſe will be; Shall not He who is ſent by God, to be the Judg of a whole Land, (<hi>Sodom</hi> and its Territory) be careful to do right; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherways, ſuch great numbers of People will receive extream Damage and Injury?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Allowing the ordinary Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there is no Neceſſity to underſtand theſe words, concerning the Angel, but of God himſelf; ſo as to make this ſenſe: Wilt thou deſtroy the Righteous, with the Wicked? that be far from thee. Shall not the Judg of the whole Earth, on whoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand thou comeſt, and whoſe Delegat thou art, do right?</p>
                  <p>And <hi>finally,</hi> if the words are meant of the Angel himſelf; He is called <hi>the Judg of the whole Earth,</hi> in the ſame regard that He is called <hi>Jehovah:</hi> even becauſe he <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi> Jehovah the Judg of the whole Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> refers to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s entertaining theſe Angels, in that Exhortation; Heb. 13.2. <hi>Forget not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Strangers, for thereby ſome have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Angels.</hi> How much more powerfully
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110211:8"/>might this Holy Writer have recommended Hoſpitality to us; if He had been of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (with our Author and his Party) that one of theſe Angels was God, or a Perſon of God? If he had ſo believed, would He have falled to ſay; <hi>Forget not to entertain Strangers, for ſome thereby have entertained God himſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much on this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He cites the Hiſtory of the Angel that met <hi>Jacob</hi> at <hi>Peniel,</hi> Gen. 32.24. An Angel <hi>met Jacob, wreſtled</hi> with him, and was <hi>worſted</hi> by him; and when he would have left him, <hi>Jacob</hi> would not ſuffer him to be gone, till he had Bleſſed him. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith, this Angel was God; for He would not tell his Name, which Angels (he ſaith) do not uſe to refuſe: and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> prayed him to Bleſs him: and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Jacob</hi> called the place of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, <hi>Peniel,</hi> or the Face of God; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſeen</hi> (El) <hi>God, face to face,</hi> Gen. 32.4.</p>
                  <p>I never before, I confeſs, ſaw this place alledged in this Cauſe: and our Author has left us to Divine, what he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from it. But I ſuppoſe his meaning is, as on the former Text; that it follows from hence, that our Lord Chriſt had a Being, <hi>before he was born of his Mother:</hi> and that the Titles and Acknowledgments, belonging to God, are given to the Lord Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I anſwer too, as before; that He has again forget the main thing, even to prove, that this Angel was (in proceſs of Time) incarnate, and called Jeſus Chriſt; of which he ſays not a word: as if we ought to take <hi>that</hi> for granted, which is the chief thing in queſtion. I ſay alſo farther; that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Allegations are very far from proving, that this Angel was God. He is indeed here called <hi>El:</hi> but <hi>El</hi> is a word uſed in Holy Scripture, indifferently of God, of Angels and of Men; as the Engliſh word LORD is.</p>
                  <p>Yet we are willing, that <hi>El</hi> ſhould be here rendred <hi>God:</hi> for ſome of the moſt learned Interpreters and Critics, of the Trinitarian Perſwaſion, have ingenuouſly owned; that the Angel is here called God, <hi>becauſe He repreſented God.</hi> So <hi>Menochius</hi> and <hi>Tirinus</hi> in Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Collection.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould I grant to our Author; that this Angel was <hi>true God:</hi> He would gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by that Conceſſion. For this Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation between <hi>Jacob</hi> and the Angel, (as that between the Angel and <hi>Balaam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) was only Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, or in <hi>Viſion;</hi> not Corporal and <hi>in Reality:</hi> as beſides the Jewiſh Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is owned by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineary Gloſs, by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> had this Viſion to comfort and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate him, and to aſſure him of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him; when He ſhould meet with his Brother <hi>Eſau:</hi> but that He might know, the Viſion was really from God; he was made to Halt on that Leg, which in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been touched by the Angel. This Interpretation is Rational; becauſe a Man could not really have prevailed, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ſays <hi>Jacob</hi> did, againſt an Angel; much leſs (as our Author ſo <hi>oddly,</hi> that I ſay no worſe, ſuppoſes) againſt God.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Third</hi> place, out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is; Pſal. 45.6, 7. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. He noteth, that theſe remarkable Words are applied to our Saviour, by the Author of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 1.8, 9. <hi>To the Son, He ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the <hi>Brief Hiſtory of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> anſwers, in ſhort; that the words both in the Hebrew and the Greek, both in the Pſalm and in the Epiſtle, might have been <hi>rendred,</hi> and <hi>interpreted</hi> after this manner: God is thy Throne (<hi>i. e.</hi> thy Seat, reſting Place, or <hi>thy Eſtabliſhment</hi>) <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> And ſo it is, that the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Grotius</hi> Tranſlates, and underſtands both theſe Texts.</p>
                  <p>But let us allow the Tranſlation in our Engliſh Bibles, <hi>Thy Throne (O God) is for ever and ever.</hi> For underſtanding this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and indeed the whole Pſalm; ſome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110211:9"/>Learned Interpreters have well noted, that this Pſalm is an <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or Marriage-Song to <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Sulamitis</hi> Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It was ſung by the Bride-Maids, ſaith <hi>Grotius, In honorens novi mariti Solomonis, &amp; novae Nuptiae Filiae Regis Aepypti; In Gratulation to the Bridegroom and Bride,</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>and the Daughter of</hi> Pharaoh. Dr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> ſays, that moſt Interpreters conclude, this Pſalm was compoſed on occaſion of the Marriage of <hi>Solomon</hi> with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter.</p>
                  <p>Any one that reads the Pſalm without Prejudice, will plainly ſee, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, of whom Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> ſpeaks, and whom he confeſſes to be <hi>the moſt,</hi> have rightly conjectured concerning this Pſalm; namely, that 'tis a Marriage-Song to <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Egyptian Bride. It begins, <hi>I will ſpeak of</hi> (or I will <hi>rehearſe</hi>) <hi>the things which I have made concerning the King.</hi> Then the Poet proceeds to deſcribe, and wiſh well to the King: <hi>Thou art fairer than the Children of Men, Grace is poured on thy Lips; thy Garments ſmell of Myrrh, Alloes and Caſſia, out of the Ivory Palaces,</hi> or Boxes. He adds, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; i. e.</hi> Thou fitteſt on the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> which is to endure <hi>for ever;</hi> for ſome deſcended from him (ſo God has promiſed) ſhall ſit thereon, till it comes to the Meſſias, or Chriſt; whoſe Kingdom ſhall be not only univerſal, as to place, but ſhall laſt <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> After theſe things ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Poem ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Queen, <hi>Hear, O Daughter, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thy own People and thy Father's Houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy Beauty. Inſtead of thy Fathers, ſhall be thy Children; whom thou mayſt make Princes in all the Earth,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in all this Land; q. d.</hi> Thou mayſt make them Governours of Tribes in all the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Oppoſers catch at the word <hi>God; thy Torone, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that word, it were neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that both the Pſalmiſt and the Author to the Hebrews do ſpeak of ſuch a Perſon, as is really and truly God. But why have they not noted, what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells them, that thoſe alſo are called <hi>Gods</hi> in Scripture, <hi>To whom the Word of God comes,</hi> Joh. 10.35. that is to ſay, Judges, Magiſtrates, and eſpecially Princes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe they hold the Place of God, and act by his general Commiſſion granted to them in his Word. For Proof of which Obſervation, he alledges the words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. concerning the Magiſtracy and Princes of <hi>Iſrael, I have ſaid, Ye are Gods.</hi> In a word, <hi>Solomon</hi> is in this Pſalm ſaluted by the Name of <hi>God,</hi> according to the known Language of thoſe Times and Countries, to Magiſtrates and Princes: and what had been ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrews, applied or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the Great (Spiritual) King, the Meſſias or Chriſt; becauſe it might (even) more properly be ſaid of him than of <hi>Solomon,</hi> even this ſaying, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> Nay, we may allow, that he more than applies the words; we may ſay, he <hi>interprets</hi> them of Chriſt; becauſe the Pſalm being compoſed by a <hi>Prophetical</hi> Poet, at the ſame time that he courted and praiſed <hi>Solomon,</hi> he might propheſy of the Lord Chriſt. This account of theſe words, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever,</hi> being ſo generally approved by the more learned Criticks of the Trinitarians; I cannot but wonder, that this Text ſhould be urged by any at this time of the day, as a Proof that the Lord Chriſt is true God, equal to the Eternal and Almighty Father of all, the dread Creator of Heaven and Earth. If it prooves the Lord Chriſt to be ſuch, it proves the ſame of <hi>Solomon,</hi> even in the Opinion of the moſt judicious of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Proof of our Author, is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>When he</hi> (God) <hi>bringeth his Firſt-begotten into the World, he ſaith,</hi> (or he commandeth) <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> His Argument from hence, is this, the Charge ſo often repeated in Scripture, of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God only, obliges Angels as well as Men: ſeeing therefore they are required to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110211:9"/>worſhip our Lord Chriſt, it follows that he is true God.</p>
                  <p>But our Author is greatly miſtaken, when he ſaith that the words, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> are taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. they are taken from the LXX Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.43. where the LXX (whoſe Tranſlation is followed generally by the Writers of the New Teſtament, and more eſpecially by the Author of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle throughout) read <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him;</hi> the very words of the Author to the Hebrews. But at <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. from whence Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> would fetch this Quotation, 'tis only ſaid, <hi>Worſhip him all ye Gods;</hi> and the words are by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters commonly underſtood of the Gods or Demons worſhipp'd by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations. Furthermore, it has been obſerved by ſome Trinitarian Criticks, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Theodoret, Epiphanius,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (all very ancient) quote theſe words, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> as taken from the LXX Tranſlation of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.43. tho the words are wanting in the preſent Hebrew Copies of the Bible, and therefore alſo in our Engliſh Bibles, as are divers other Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, cited by the Writers of the New.</p>
                  <p>The words in that Text of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> are ſpoken of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Nations are there bid to <hi>rejoice</hi> with, and the Angels to <hi>worſhip Iſrael;</hi> that is, to guard, ſerve and watch over him. But theſe words intended originally of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are, by the Author to the Hebrews, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and applied likewiſe to the Lord Chriſt; becauſe the Angels had in charge to ſuccour and <hi>miniſter</hi> to him alſo. Yet not to him only, but to all his Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>They are all Miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſuch as ſhall be Heirs of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have juſt ſuch another Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Application of a Text to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which was originally meant of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.15. there the Evangeliſh ſaith, that Jeſus was brought by <hi>Joſeph</hi> (his Foſter-Father) out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into <hi>Judea;</hi> and ſo, ſaith he, was fulfilled the Word of God by the Prophet, <hi>Out of</hi> Egypt <hi>I have called my Son.</hi> But any one that looks into the Context of the Prophet, will plainly ſee, that thoſe words were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally meant and deſigned of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God there vouchſafes to call his Son. The words of the Prophet are theſe, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.1. <hi>When</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a Child,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> in the firſt Ages of that People) <hi>then I loved him, and called my Son out of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when ſuch Texts are either <hi>interpreted</hi> of Chriſt, or <hi>accommodated</hi> and <hi>applied</hi> to him, we are to underſtand it after this manner; that thoſe Texts were <hi>again</hi> fulfilled, or had <hi>a ſecond</hi> Completion in the Perſon of our Lord Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But our Author urges, that the Precept of worſhipping only God, obliges Angels and Men; therefore how could the Angels be required to worſhip Chriſt, if he were not true God?</p>
                  <p>It ſeems then, he has not obſerved what is ſaid at 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20. <hi>The Congregation bleſſed the Lord God of their Fathers; and bowing the Head, they worſhipped the Lord and the King.</hi> Nor has he noted, how often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Perſons worſhipp'd our Saviour while he was upon Earth. The meaning is not, that they worſhipp'd either <hi>David</hi> or our Saviour with <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, but with a <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Worſhip, ſuch as is due to Kings and to Prophets on the account of him that ſent them. The Lord Chriſt has an Office, that of King and Head of the Church, higher than any Angel; nay, ſo high, that he may make uſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Angels in the Execution of his Office: therefore they are bid to worſhip him, not with <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, (no more than they were to worſhip <hi>Iſrael</hi> with ſuch Worſhip) but with the Worſhip or <hi>Reſpect</hi> that is due to him in regard of his Office; as the Congregation worſhipp'd <hi>David,</hi> in the Text laſt quoted, in regard of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Royal Dignity. But, as I obſerved
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110211:10"/>before, the Worſhip principally meant in the words, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> is to be underſtood of ſuccouring and miniſtring to him, while he was upon Earth, as they were to worſhip <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Continuation of the Examination of the Texts, objected from the Old Teſtament.</head>
               <p>OUR Author's <hi>fifth</hi> Objection is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. (words taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25, 26, 27.) <hi>And thou, Lord, in the beginning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth; and the Heavens are the Works of thy Hands. They ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt: they ſhall wax old as does a Garment; And as a Veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and they ſhall be changed: but thou art the ſame, and thy Years fail not.</hi> Let us add the next words, at <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>But to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Sit at my Right-hand, until I make thine enemies the Foot-ſtool?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith, theſe words here cited, to <hi>v.</hi> 13. are intended of the Son our Lord Chriſt; and that by aſcribing to him the Creation of the Heavens and Earth, they aſſure us, both of the Pre-eternity and the Divinity of the ſaid our Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen before, that the Writers of the New Teſtament do accommodate divers Paſſages and Expreſſions of the Old Teſtament to our Saviour; tho originally, and in their primary Intention, they were meant of other Perſons; becauſe ſuch Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Expreſſions had <hi>another,</hi> and a <hi>ſecond</hi> Completion, in the Perſon of the Lord Chriſt. Thus, what was ſaid of <hi>Solomon, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our Saviour, becauſe he alſo has an everlaſting Throne: and what was ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, Out of</hi> Egypt <hi>I have called my Son,</hi> is too accommodated to Chriſt; becauſe he likewiſe was called out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Herod.</hi> In like ſort, in this Context to the Hebrews, what had been ſaid by the Pſalmiſt, of God, and of the old or <hi>firſt</hi> Creation, (<hi>Thou, Lord, in the beginning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Works of thy Hands,</hi> &amp;c.) is accommodated to the Lord Chriſt, and to the <hi>new</hi> Creation which he hath made, even <hi>the new Heavens and the new Earth, in which</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays of them) <hi>dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Goſpel-ſtate and Times, or the <hi>Church</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Synagogue</hi> and Jewiſh Oeconomy, is deſcribed very often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the Names of the New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and New Earth. Iſa. 65.17. <hi>Behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth; and the former ſhall be remembred no more.</hi> Iſa. 66.22. <hi>As the new Heavens and the new Earth, which I will make, ſhall remain before me; ſo ſhall your Seed and your Name remain.</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had deſcribed the fearful Diſſolution of the Jewiſh Oeconomy and State, in terms much like thoſe uſed by our Saviour on the ſame occaſion and Subject, at <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. adds, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Nevertheleſs, according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, we look for new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi> That is, a new Oeconomy and State, in which not ſo much a <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> as a <hi>Moral</hi> and true Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall be taught and practiſed. Rev. 21.1. <hi>I ſaw a new Heaven, and a new Earth; for the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away. i. e.</hi> He ſaw <hi>the Church,</hi> or Chriſtian Oeconomy begin; the Jewiſh or old Oeconomy, or Law was aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>All the Trinitarian Interpreters do thus underſtand theſe Texts; namely, that by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110211:10"/>the New Heavens and New Earth is meant the Goſpel-ſtate of things, in oppoſition to the Jewiſh, which is antiquated and done away. This is the Earth, and theſe the Heavens, of which the Lord Chriſt is the Maker, under God; partly by Himſelf, partly by his Apoſtles and other true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel: and theſe the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> meaneth, when he ſays here, of our Lord Chriſt; <hi>Thou, Lord, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning haſt laid the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Works of thy Hands: they ſhall be changed,</hi> (from their ſtate of Probation and Trial, to a ſtate of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Enjoyment) <hi>but thou remaineſt for ever the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation this is, rightly obſerves; that the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom this Epiſtle was written, did commonly ſpeak of the Times of the Meſſias (or Chriſt) in theſe very terms here uſed: namely, that He ſhould <hi>make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, New</hi> Heavens and Earth; meaning thereby, a Total change of the face of things, in the Church and Religion. And thoſe Forms of ſpeaking, they borrowed from the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> whoſe words I have before quoted. Therefore in writing to them, it was no ſurprize to them; that this Epiſtle ſhould accommodate the words of the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Pſalmiſt, uſed by him concerning God and the <hi>firſt</hi> Creation, to the Meſſias and the <hi>New</hi> Creation; becauſe in him they had <hi>Another,</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion.</p>
               <p>Others of our Party, give other Accounts of this Text; this for one; that the words, <hi>Thou, Lord, in the beginning haſt laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. are not at all (in any ſenſe) intended of <hi>our Saviour;</hi> but are a devout Apoſtrophe Converſion or Addreſs to <hi>God,</hi> that is, to the Father; ſo as to make this ſenſe. <q>And truly thou, Lord, who haſt thus anointed and exalted thy Son, art the God who haſt laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth; and the Heavens are the Work of thy Hands: — But to which of his Angels, hath this Glorious and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable</hi> Creator at any time ſaid; as He doth by the Inſpired and <hi>Prophetical</hi> Pſalmiſt to the Son our Lord Chriſt; Sit on my right Hand, till I make thy Enemies thy Foot-ſtool?</q> Here we ought to note, that the words, <hi>Sit at my right Hand, till I make thy Enemies thy Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool,</hi> are originally and primarily intended of <hi>David;</hi> as is owned by the Trinitarian Interpreters: but they are applied to Chriſt in this Context to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> becauſe they are alſo <hi>a Prophecy of him;</hi> and of what God would do for him. In a word, their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>with reſpect to the Lord Chriſt,</hi> is this; God hath <hi>(in his Decree)</hi> ſaid concerning the Meſſias or Chriſt, who ſhall in due time be manifeſted, <hi>Sit on my right hand, till I make thy Enemies thy Footſtool:</hi> This is the Senſe of the words, as they ſtand in the Pſalm. See the Learned Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe and Notes, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder, Sir, that our Oppoſer took no notice of theſe two Interpretations of theſe words, <hi>Thou, Lord, in the beginning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. they were too Rational and Probable, to be ſet in the ſame Light and View with the <hi>Wild</hi> Conſtruction, that He and his Party make of this Context. For they make this Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to ſay; that the Lord Chriſt is the Creator of the <hi>Viſible</hi> Earth and Heavens: and yet that 'tis Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon,, that muſt ſubdue to him the Enemies of his Kingdom, and make them his Foot-ſtool.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot, Sir, to tell you; that as <hi>Grotius</hi> is the Author of the firſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which I have given of this Context; ſo 'tis <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Doctor, thus has obſerved and ſuggeſted the other.</p>
               <p>He alledgeth <hi>next</hi> (thô not out of the Old Teſtament, according to his propoſed Method) Heb. 1.1, 2. <hi>God who at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times—ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt times ſpoken to us by his Son; by whom alſo He made the Worlds.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is not pleaſed to take notice, that <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:110211:11"/>renders the laſt Clauſe by, <hi>For whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo He made the Worlds: i. e.</hi> the World was at firſt made, with intention to ſubject it (in the fulneſs of Time) to the Meſſias and his Law. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> rather choſe to ſay here, <hi>The World was made for the Meſſias;</hi> becauſe it was a common Saying among the Jews, a part of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Belief concerning the Meſſias: there is nothing more common in their Books, than this Saying, The World was made for the Meſſih, who ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Nor has our Oppoſer thought fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſome of the beſt Critics of his own Party, have thus rendred the objected Text; <hi>By whom alſo he made the AGES:</hi> and that they interpret <hi>the AGES</hi> to be <hi>the Goſpel-Ages;</hi> which were made by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of our Lord Chriſt. No, theſe were Interpretations, which 'twas better for him to overlook, than to attempt, in vain, to refute them.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſeventh</hi> Proof is from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;</hi>— <hi>his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Counſellor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith, this Text is <hi>univerſally</hi> applied to the Bleſſed Jeſus; and that 'tis ſtrange, that he ſhould be called <hi>the Mighty God,</hi> if He is not God at all. He ſaith farther, that <hi>Everlaſting Father</hi> could not without Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity be applied to the Lord Chriſt; if as the Socinians ſay of him, there was <hi>a time when He was not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this, the Author of the <hi>Brief Hiſtory</hi> hath Anſwered, that this Text of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is <hi>Never</hi> applied to our Saviour, by any Writer of the New Teſtament: thô Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> is pleaſed here to ſay, 'tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally applied to him. The Hiſtorian ſhows the Reaſon, why the Writers of the New Teſtament have not applied this Text to the Lord Chriſt; becauſe it apparently ſpeaks of one, actually born at that time when the Prophet wrote; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child IS born, unto us a Son IS given;</hi> but the Prophet wrote about 700 Years before the Birth of our Saviour. He adds, that <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and divers others (Chriſtian and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, as well as Jewiſh Interpreters) underſtand the Text, of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King of <hi>Judah;</hi> and that it hath been Tranſlated very extravagantly into Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The truth is, there are almoſt as many Tranſlations of this Verſe, as there are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. Inſtead of the words, <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Mighty God;</hi> the LXX Interpreters ſay, <hi>the Angel</hi> (or Meſſenger) <hi>of Great Counſel; i. e.</hi> the Wiſe Meſſenger: they wholly omit the following words, even theſe, <hi>the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, &amp;c.</hi> thoſe words (it ſhould ſeem) have been added ſince their time, to the Hebrew Copies of the Bible.</p>
               <p>The Fathers generally follow this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the LXX. <hi>M. Luther,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Hebrew very well, inſtead of <hi>Mighty God,</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Mighty Heroe,</hi> or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Conſulter of the Mighty God;</hi> and interprets thus, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhall conſult with God, not with the Idols of his Father <hi>Ahaz,</hi> both in his Enterpriſes and his Troubles. For <hi>Everlaſting Father,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and other Critics read, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Age;</hi> and for <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> they read <hi>the Peaceable Prince:</hi> becauſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> would not enterprize Needleſs Wars; but ſeek to maintain the Peace, Property and Plenty of his People.</p>
               <p>When the words in the Original (He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew or Greek) are of ſuch doubtful and ambiguous Conſtruction; 'tis the manner of our Oppoſers, to take that Occaſion, to ſet up their <hi>Wonders:</hi> We, on the contrary, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not <hi>Monſtroſities;</hi> but are governed by the obvious Reaſon and Poſſibilities of things. We think, 'tis enough to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us to ſome or other of the <hi>Reaſonable</hi> and <hi>Poſſible</hi> Senſes, before-mentioned; that the Writers of the New Teſtament never apply this Text to our Saviour; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prophet ſo plainly ſpeaks of a Child <hi>then</hi> born, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child IS born, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Son IS given.</hi>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110211:11"/>His <hi>eighth</hi> Text from the Old Teſtament, is, Jerem. 23.5, 6. <hi>The days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe up to</hi> David <hi>a Righteous Branch;—in his days,</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely: and this is the Name whereby He ſhall be called, The LORD our Righteouſneſs.</hi> This BRANCH, ſaith our Author, is by Rabbins and Fathers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the Meſſias or Chriſt: and that He is <hi>God,</hi> appears by the Name here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, <hi>Jehovah Tſidkenn,</hi> or <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> And agreeable to this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>The Lord Chriſt is of God made to us, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Author's firſt and great Miſtake here, is this; that on Suppoſition, that 'tis the Lord Chriſt who is here called <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> He muſt needs be true God. For let us hear another Text of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Jerem. 33.16. <hi>In thoſe days</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is the Name wherewith SHE</hi> (Jeruſalem) <hi>ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> We ſee by this laſt Text, that <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs</hi> in the other Text, is not meant of the <hi>Branch,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Branch be the Lord Chriſt, as our Author <hi>thinks;</hi> or <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> has <hi>proved</hi>) but <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Nation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So that we ought to underſtand the objected Text, after this manner. <q>In thoſe days, I will raiſe up to <hi>David,</hi> a Righteous Branch;—and in his time <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell ſafely: and this is the Name, wherewith He (<hi>Iſrael,</hi> not <hi>the Branch</hi>) ſhall be called, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis promiſed here in theſe Texts, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be called, <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> in the days of <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> who was their Governour (Vice-King for the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>) immediately after the return from the Captivity: becauſe it would then pleaſe God, to pardon all the paſt Sins of that People, and to deal with them as a <hi>Righteous</hi> People; notwithſtanding their former Tranſgreſſions, and <hi>National</hi> Revolts from him.</p>
               <p>Others have obſerved, that the words in both Contexts, may be rendred <hi>the Lord our Juſtifier;</hi> or the Lord <hi>is</hi> our Juſtifier: and ſo they make this Senſe; In the Days of the Branch, in the Government of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> God will juſtify and deliver us, from all our Adverſaries and Perſecutors.</p>
               <p>His <hi>laſt</hi> Old Teſtament Text, is <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Thou</hi> Bethlehem,—<hi>out of thee ſhall come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>whoſe goings forth have been from Old, from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting;</hi> or, <hi>from the Days of Eternity.</hi> He noteth, that this Text is Interpreted of the Lord Chriſt; even by the chief Prieſts and Scribes of the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Thô our Author had not Deſigned to take notice, what the Heterodox Socinians An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in defence of their Doctrine of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God;</hi> or how They interpret the Texts, objected to that <hi>Hereſy</hi> of theirs: yet at leaſt Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> was worthy to be heard. This famous Reformer owns, that the Prophet's meaning is only this; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of the Lord Chriſt have been <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by God,</hi> from the Days of Eternity.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Grotius</hi> inſtead of <hi>From Everlaſting,</hi> or from the Days of Eternity, hath Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here <hi>from ancient Days;</hi> and ſo (All know) the words may be rendred: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he maketh the Senſe to be this; Whoſe Goings forth (<hi>i. e.</hi> whoſe <hi>Deſcent,</hi> Original, or Pedigree) is of Old, from Ancient Times.

               </p>

                  <p>He begins with <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>This was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Lord, by the Prophet, ſaying, A Virgin ſhall Conceive, and ſhall bring forth a Son; and they ſhall call his Name Immanuel; which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, is, God with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He notes, that theſe words are ſpoken of the Lord Chriſt; and that the Name <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> (or <hi>God with us</hi>) has been <hi>appropriated</hi> to him, by God: for we no where find, that He hath given this Name to any other. But where God giveth a Name, and the Spirit of God interprets it; it cannot be inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant: from whence it follows, that the Lord Chriſt is indeed <hi>God Eternal,</hi> and <hi>God with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this, I ſay; thô the Conſonants of the Hebrew Name <hi>Immanuel</hi> may be ſo <hi>Pointed,</hi> that the Name may be Interpreted <hi>God with Him;</hi> which would turn the Objection from this Text, upon our Oppoſers: yet <hi>that</hi> is not here to be inſiſted on; becauſe we ſhall ſee preſently, that in giving that Name, it was really intended, the Child ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or named <hi>God with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> The Text here objected out of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is taken from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. where that Prophet tells <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> who was at that time invaded by the Confederate Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that the Confederacy of theſe two Kings againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhould in the end come to nothing: and that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer a Nation, within the term of 65 Years. And for a Sign to you, ſays the Prophet, that God will bring this to paſs; a Virgin (one who at preſent is a Virgin) ſhall forthwith Conceive by her Husband, and bring forth a Son, whom God will have to be called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> or <hi>God with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before this Child is of Years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to know Good and Evil, God will indeed appear to be on our Side; He will withdraw by Death the two Kings, who are Confederate againſt us. There is no Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Critic that doubts, that the Child here promiſed by the Prophet to be a Sign of the Truth of what He had ſaid, about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of the Two Kings, and the final Deſtruction of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is <hi>Maher-Shalal-Haſhbaz</hi> Son of this Prophet, by the Wiſe whom (it ſhould ſeem) He had lately taken: And They obſerve, that this is the Reaſon, why he ſaith in the next Chapter; <hi>I and the Children whom the Lord hath given me, are for Signs in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>from the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 8.18. But whether the Child <hi>Immanuel</hi> was the Son of the Prophet, or of ſome other; this is certain, that He was to be a Sign to King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> This Child being to be ſuch a Sign, the Sign of ſo favourable a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ahaz,</hi> had an Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name given to him by order from God; even <hi>Immanuel,</hi> or <hi>God with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> Therefore our Author's Firſt Obſervation is certainly falſe; that the Name <hi>Immanuel</hi> was <hi>Appropriated</hi> to the Lord Chriſt, and <hi>no where</hi> given by God to any other Perſon. And ſo too is his other Note, that becauſe God gave to him the Name <hi>Immanuel,</hi> He muſt needs be <hi>true God;</hi> for God gave the ſame
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110211:12"/>Name to the Child that was to be a Sign to <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> that God would be <hi>with them</hi> (or <hi>for them</hi>) by deſtroying their Enemies, the Syrians and Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>We ſee that the words of the Prophet were originally intended, of a Child that was to be a Sign to <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> and that there was a good reaſon why that Name ſhould be given to him. But St. <hi>Matthew</hi> accommodates and applies both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and the Name to our Lord Chriſt, becauſe in him they had <hi>another</hi> and a <hi>ſecond</hi> Completion; we may ſay, <hi>a more perfect</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion. For the Lord Chriſt was our <hi>Immanuel,</hi> or <hi>God with us;</hi> not only as he was <hi>a Sign</hi> that God would be on our ſide, which was the only reaſon of the Name of the firſt <hi>Immanuel;</hi> but becauſe he did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conciliate God to us, and us to God; and becauſe God was <hi>with</hi> him, and <hi>in</hi> him, by an extraordinary Effuſion of his Spirit upon him.</p>
                  <p>No one can be ſo blind or obſtinate, as not to acknowledg, that this Interpretation (which indeed is not ours, but advanced by divers of the principal Trinitarian Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters) is eaſy and rational, perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ſcope of the Prophet; and alſo to the manner of writing obſerved by this, and the other Evangeliſts; who very uſually apply divers Texts of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, intended originally of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to the Lord Chriſt; becauſe in him they had a ſecond and (very often) a more perfect fulfilling. Therefore let our Oppoſers ſhow cauſe why we ſhould depart from an Interpretation every way reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to imbrace and adhere to theirs; which implies a Doctrine contrary to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and to the whole Current of Scripture, even this, that there is more than one Divine Perſon, or more than one who is true God.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument is from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He obſerves here, that the Son and Spirit are ſet <hi>equally</hi> with the Father, as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Baptiſmal Faith; which either proves their real Equality, or is of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Import, for 'tis apt to impreſs upon us falſe Notions of the Deity, and to make us think thoſe to be really equal, who are not ſo. He ſaith moreover, that in other Texts where God is joined with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; a diſtinction is made, whereby to diſcern that one is God, and the other but Creatures; but not ſo in this Text; we are bid here to be baptized, equally and alike to the Father, Son and Spirit, without any Note of Dignity or Superiority in one more than in another of them; therefore they muſt be underſtood to be equal.</p>
                  <p>It may be our Author knows not, that ſome Learned Criticks have given very ſtrong Reaſons why they believe, that theſe words of the objected Text, <hi>In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,</hi> were not ſpoke by our Saviour, but have been added to the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> from the common <hi>Form</hi> and Practice of the Church in adminiſtring Baptiſm; as 'tis certain that theſe words, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory for ever,</hi> have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lord's-Prayer in the ſame Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> from the Greek Liturgies or Forms of Common-Prayer. Theſe Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks obſerve, that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry with the Unitarians who maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Diſpute at <hi>Alba;</hi> becauſe they ſaid, thoſe words were added to the Bible but only ſince the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council had corrupted the Faith; all Antiquity, ſaith the Cardinal, is witneſs againſt them, that thoſe words were always read in the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi> But the Learned Cardinal does not produce one Teſtimony, in Confirmation of what he ſays, tho he uſes to be very free in his Quotations of Fathers, and ancient Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians. In ſhort, we have nothing but Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s word for it, that the Ancients did read the words, <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas ſome pretend to find theſe words cited by St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as ſpoken by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110211:13"/>our Saviour, in the Epiſtle of the ſaid <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to the Philippians: that Epiſtle is (all of it) a meer Forgery, by Confeſſion of all the Criticks who have publiſh'd the Works of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or have written Notes upon them. They obſerve, that Epiſtle is never quoted by any of the Ancients, nor was heard of in the World before <hi>Ado Viennenſis,</hi> who flouriſh'd about the Year 859.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the famous Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, quotes the objected Text <hi>nine</hi> times in ſeveral parts of his Works, but never with the words, <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he reads thus, <hi>Teach all Nations in my Name, inſtructing them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſtant Practice of the ancient Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, was, to baptize only <hi>in the Name of the Lord Chriſt;</hi> and therefore it was ordered by the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that the Pauliniſts (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Unitarians) who came over to the Church, ſhould be re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Whether they or the Catholick Church (ſo called) are in the right concerning the Form of Baptiſm, is beſt determined from the Practice of the Apoſtles: for we cannot well ſuppoſe, that if the Form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Saviour himſelf, was, <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</hi> that the Apoſtles would depart from that Form; or that 'twas lawful for them ſo to do. But where-ever there is mention in Scripture-Hiſtory, of the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, either by the Apoſtles, or by their Order, the Form of ſuch Baptiſm was only, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Chriſt;</hi> or, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Lord Chriſt.</hi> Acts 2.38. Peter <hi>ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The ſame thing is ſaid at <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. Add to this, that beſides the School-men and other Moderns, St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> do expreſly own, that the Apoſtles adminiſtred Baptiſm only in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Finally, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſts mention the Inſtitution of Baptiſm by our Saviour after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but they ſay not, that he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be adminiſtred, <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which 'tis not likely they would have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if our Saviour had injoined that Form of performing the Rite of Baptiſm. Nay, it ſhould ſeem, by what St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, that the Form of Baptiſm appointed by our Saviour, was only in his (Chriſt's) Name, not in the Name of more Perſons. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.46, 47. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, that Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name, unto all Nations.</hi> Here <hi>Remiſſion of Sins</hi> ſeems to be no other thing but <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred <hi>in Chriſt's Name,</hi> as a ſign of the Remiſſion of Sins; and therefore it is, that elſewhere inſtead of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins;</hi> the holy Writers ſay <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> To this effect ſpeak the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Criticks; and from hence they infer, that we cannot make uſe of this Text to warrant the Church's Form of Baptiſm, <hi>In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> much leſs to prove that the two latter are God (or <hi>Gods</hi>) equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>I deſire and reſolve, Sir, to argue this great Queſtion, concerning the Divinity of our Saviour; or, whether there is more than one Divine Perſon, with all poſſible ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Therefore I will ingenuouſly own to you, that tho the before-mentioned Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this Text, are not without their weight; yet I have obſerved divers things, which make me to think, that this Text is a genuine part of Scripture, was ſpoken by our Saviour, and written by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis found in all the Copies of the Bible, both <hi>Printed</hi> and <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> and in all the ancient Tranſlations, which cannot be ſaid of any other Text, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by us or by our Oppoſers; all the doubtful and ſuſpected Texts are wanting in divers Copies of the Original Greek, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110211:13"/>of the Ancient Tranſlations. I conceive, we ought not to argue againſt the Truth of any Text from only <hi>Negative</hi> Proofs, or from ſome <hi>poſſible</hi> Interpretations of other Texts, tho thoſe Texts are perhaps <hi>many.</hi> It ought to be ſhown, that either Church-Hiſtorians or Fathers have ſaid, that ſuch Text was <hi>not read,</hi> or was <hi>otherways read</hi> in the Copies of their Times.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To the Allegations out of the Acts of the Apoſtles, and ſome Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> it may be anſwered, That thoſe Texts mention only <hi>the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and not the other two Names, <hi>the Father</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> becauſe by <hi>the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>unto the Lord Jeſus,</hi> they mean, to the Profeſſion of the Lord Jeſus, and of the Doctrine by him taught, without at all intending to expreſs by thoſe words the <hi>Form</hi> of Baptiſm, which every one knew to be <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I like this Interpretation; becauſe when St. <hi>Paul</hi> asked ſome Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they they had yet received the Holy Ghoſt? and they had anſwered, that they had not heard whether there was an Holy Ghoſt: He replies, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then were ye baptized? Acts</hi> 19.3. This Reply of the Apoſtle ſeems to ſuppoſe, that if they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>with Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi> (and not only with the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi>) they muſt needs have heard of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe the Form was in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ancient Unitarians bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed only <hi>in the Name of the Lord Chriſt:</hi> I think 'tis grounded only on the Report of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> I. who might not underſtand their Diſcipline, or deſignedly miſreport it: and beſides, his Epiſtles are ſuppoſed to be forged by moſt learned Men; becauſe they make mention of Rites and Perſons that were not in Being in <hi>Innocent</hi>'s time.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly; Whereas the Unitarians at <hi>Alba</hi> ſaid, that this Text has been added to St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſince the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; tho Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has only <hi>denied</hi> this, he might moſt eaſily have proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flouriſh'd above 120 Years before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, often quotes this Text. In his Book concerning <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> Chap. 13. he ſaith, <hi>The Law of baptizing is impoſed, and the Form preſcribed: Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</hi> And again, in his Book againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> Chap. 26. <hi>After his Reſurrection, he commanded, that they ſhould baptize to the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; not to one of them only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, none of the Ante-Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do ever alledg this Form of Baptiſm, to prove the Divinity of the Son or Holy Spirit; but the reaſon of that was, becauſe tho they allowed that the Son might be called <hi>God,</hi> on account of his perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction (by Love, Unity of Will, and Subjection) with the Father, who only is true God; yet they thought otherwiſe of the Holy Ghoſt: ſome of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him to be only the Energy, or Power of God; others that he was a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Son, and only the chief of the miniſtring Spirits or Angels. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Oppoſer.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, We are baptized <hi>alike</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> to the Father, Son and Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two <hi>latter</hi> are equal in all reſpects to the <hi>former,</hi> or, are God no leſs than he; they are mentioned <hi>together</hi> in this Text, without any Note of Dignity or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in one more than in another, which were of dangerous Conſequence, and apt to lead Men into Error, if only one of theſe is true God.</p>
                  <p>But, 1. 'Tis not true, that here is no Note of Diſtinction or Superiority; for the words at length are theſe; <hi>All Power is given to me, in Heaven and Earth; go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> I would know of our Oppoſer, what greater Diſtinction could be made, than our Saviour here makes between God and himſelf? doth he not here expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and own, that his Power is <hi>given to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110211:14"/>him;</hi> that he hath <hi>received it</hi> from the Liberality of another, and not from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Can any one be ſaid to give Power to himſelf? And the Apoſtle hath told us, how we are to underſtand it, that <hi>all Power</hi> is given to the Lord Chriſt; in theſe words to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> God <hi>gave to him to be Head over all things, to the Church:</hi> Epheſ. 1.22. As who ſhould ſay, He is over all things, and hath all Power, <hi>with reſpect to the Church:</hi> 'tis He, and He only that muſt preſcribe her <hi>ſtanding</hi> Laws and Rites; and appoint by what Perſons, and what Means, the Church ſhall be firſt gathered, and then preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſing now there had been no Note of Superiority here made, or Diſtinction of Dignity and Power; I ſee not what could be truly inferred from thence to the advantage of our Author's Cauſe. For when God is joined in the ſame form of Speech with any others; ſure <hi>that</hi> needs not to be expreſſed, which all Men know and acknowledg, even God's Superiority above all others. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20. <hi>The Congregation bowed their Heads, and worſhipped the Lord, and the King.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. <hi>I charge thee before God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels.</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come.</hi> Will our Author ſay upon theſe Texts, and upon that other (parallel) Text, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. <hi>All the People greatly feared the Lord, and</hi> Samuel? Will he ſay, that <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Angels and the Bride (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Church) are equal with God or with the Spirit, becauſe they are mentioned <hi>together,</hi> without any Note of Diſtinction, or of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Superiority in one more than in the other? The Acts of Religion mentioned in thoſe Texts, are no leſs ſolemn or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant than Baptiſm is; <hi>fearing</hi> the Lord, <hi>worſhipping</hi> the Lord, <hi>adjuring</hi> by the Lord, are the very higheſt Acts of Devotion and Religion; yet even in them God is joined with Creatures, without any Mark of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction or Superiority; becauſe (as I ſaid) when God is joined with any others, there is no need of ſuch Note or Mark.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the more learned of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, eſpecially the Ancients of the firſt 400 Years, do not inſiſt on this Text of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> to prove the Divinity or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality of the Son or Spirit: by theſe words, <hi>In the Name of the Father, Son and Spirit,</hi> they underſtand only, <hi>to the Profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>to the Obedience</hi> of the Father, Son and Spirit. According to theſe Criticks, the Senſe of the objected Text is only this: Baptize the Nations into the Profeſſion and Obedience of the Father, or God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to <hi>hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto us;</hi> and of the other Teacher, even the Spirit or Inſpiration of God, by which he adviſes and comforts the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all <hi>extraordinary</hi> Exigences. Our Author may pleaſe to conſult. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Collections on this Text, where he will ſee divers ſuch Interpretations as this, all of them by the Criticks of his own Party, and all of them conſiſtent with <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God,</hi> as 'tis held by the Socinians. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe Interpreters and Criticks muſt be underſtood as giving up to us this Text.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> On the firſt Verſes of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel.</head>
               <p>OUR Author's next Effort, is from that well-known Context, even the firſt Verſes of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel: The Clauſes by him urged, are theſe; <hi>In the Beginning was the WORD; and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was God. All things were made by Him,</hi> namely by the WORD; <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him was not any thing made, that was made.—He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not.</hi> Others have added to theſe; <hi>And the WORD was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us.</hi> Alſo that Teſtimony of the Baptiſt, <hi>He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for He was before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Author endeavours to Ridicule the common Socinian Interpretation of theſe Verſes, by Miſrepreſenting it; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the remarkable and probable Proofs, which the Socinians add to every Clauſe of their Interpretation.</p>
               <p>He recites alſo the Explication of this Context by Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> which, he ſaith, is a full Explication, and the Senſe of the Catholic Church. Indeed Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has given us the Belief of the Catholic Church, ſo called; and has ſet it down as the Senſe of this Context of St. <hi>John:</hi> but that's the very thing in queſtion, whether that <hi>Belief</hi> be the Senſe of theſe Verſes.</p>
               <p>Our preſent Oppoſer has performed ſo Meanly, in the long Diſcourſe he has made on this Proem of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, that I am not willing to be ſeen, maintaining a Scuffle with him. Others of his Party have known, how to make a vigorous Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from this Context; the ſum of what they ſay, is;</p>
               <p>Every Clauſe here objected, is a ſeveral Argument againſt the Socinian Hereſy: The Firſt declares the Real <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by aſſerting his <hi>Eternity;</hi> in theſe words, <hi>In the Beginning</hi> (as who ſhould ſay, from the very Firſt, or from all Eternity) <hi>was the WORD.</hi> The ſecond Clauſe ſaith, The WORD was <hi>with</hi> God, to ſignify the <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> and <hi>perpetual</hi> Generation of the WORD or Son; and alſo the <hi>mutual Inexiſtence</hi> of theſe two Divine Perſons in one another. The <hi>next</hi> yet more Directly, and even Expreſly, contradicts the Socinians; by ſaying, <hi>the WORD was God:</hi> They ſay, He was a <hi>Man,</hi> and no more than a Man. 'Tis true, they allow He may be called God, in ſuch ſenſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a God, (and that by God himſelf) at <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. in that He was to repreſent the Perſon of God, being to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God's Commands to <hi>Pharaob;</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> But our Evangeliſt has been careful to prevent theſe Evaſions, by telling us what kind of God the WORD was; <hi>All things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leſt Incredulous and Obſtinate Men ſhould interpret <hi>all things</hi> in theſe words, to be only <hi>All things belonging to the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate;</hi> or the whole Oeconomy and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel; as the Socinians would now wreſt St. <hi>John</hi>'s words: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent (I ſay) this Eluſion, he adds yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>He was in the World, and the World was made by him.</hi> But this Holy Evangeliſt has not yet done with them; He ſays, at <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us:</hi> 'Twere Nonſenſe to ſpeak ſo, of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was only a Man; Who ever ſaid, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or <hi>James</hi> were made Fleſh, and dwelt among us? Would it not be Ridiculous ſo to ſpeak? Therefore the Lord Jeſus was more than a Man, He was God made <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Man;</hi> for Fleſh is a very uſual
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110211:15"/>Scripture-Term for Man. He was made Man, by being Incarnate in an Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by an Hypoſtatical Union to a Body of Fleſh and a Rational Soul. This Evangeliſt has given us too, the Teſtimony of the other <hi>John,</hi> even <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> concerning the Prae-exiſtence or Prae-eternity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; <hi>He that cometh after me, is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for be was before me.</hi> We are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly told by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was ſix Months older than our Lord Chriſt, <hi>as Man:</hi> Therefore when St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, Chriſt was before him; it muſt be thus underſtood, that as God He was before <hi>John,</hi> thô as Man He was younger than <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, the Socinians have ſtrained their Wits, to give other Senſes of theſe Verſes; or ſo to interpret them, as to make their Saviour nothing but a Man; not God, not a Creatour, no not ſo much as an Angel, but a meer Man. Now when Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may have divers Senſes, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, that there are no <hi>Primitive Acts,</hi> to aſcertain one of the Senſes above, or rather than another of them: but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has been watchful on behalf of the true Faith, and the Catholic Interpretation of theſe Verſes, by preſerving to us <hi>Ancient Acts,</hi> and ſuch as muſt needs ſatisfy ſincere and teachable Perſons; the Church is in poſſeſſion of moſt certain Records, by which ſhe indubitably proves the Catholic Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this Context.</p>
               <p>The Socinians are not the Firſt Authors of this Hereſy, that there is but one Divine Perſon, (even the God and Father of our Lord Chriſt) and that the Lord Chriſt was nothing elſe but a Prophet, and the Holy Spirit only the Power and Inſpiration of God. The <hi>Nazarens,</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and <hi>Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> immediately after the Death of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, began to propagate this Hereſy, to the great Offence and Scandal of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And it ſo hapned, that many heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to them; inſomuch that the Biſhops and Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> importuned St. <hi>John,</hi> to write ſomewhat more expreſly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divinity of our Saviour, than had been yet done by any of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> was at length prevailed on, to do as they deſired; only he requeſted, that a General Faſt might be held, to invoke the Aid of God on his Undertaking. The Faſt being ended, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon him; and He began his Goſpel <hi>with theſe words, which came to him from Heaven; In the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the WORD, and the Word was with God, and the WORD was God; All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> This Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made by St. <hi>Jerom, Proem. Com.</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> And he declares in the ſame place; that this was no uncertain Rumour, nor a thing of Hear-ſay; <hi>Sed ita narrat Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Hiſtoria, The Church-Hiſtory ſo tells us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Socinians therefore ſweat to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in deviſing Comments or <hi>Eluſions</hi> on this Context, which was deſignedly written againſt them: 'tis in vain for them to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their own Inventions to Primitive Acts, which tell us plainly; that this Goſpel was written on purpoſe againſt their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; nay, that the words of it, with which we pretend to confute them, <hi>came down from Heaven,</hi> or were ſpoken againſt them from Heaven; St. <hi>John</hi> being only the Penman, not the Author of them.</p>
               <p>Thus it is, Sir, that the Socinians are Baffled, by <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>Senſeleſs</hi> Tranſlations, ſupported by Fictions and <hi>Legends.</hi> There never was a Greater <hi>Flamm,</hi> than this Tale of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> out of an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, never ſeen by any body but Himſelf. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> two Hundred Years older than St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and therefore ſo much nearer to matter of Fact, could ſay nothing of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel; but this: <hi>He publiſh'd it at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>in</hi> Aſia, <hi>Adverſ. Haereſ. Lib.</hi> 3. c. 1. <hi>Origen,</hi> who had made ſo diligent a ſearch among all the Monuments of Antiquity, that He might be able to give an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Writers of Holy Scriptures; ſays, <q>Concerning the four Evangeliſts, we have received by Tradition, as follows. St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> firſt a Publican, afterwards an Apoſtle, wrote his Goſpel in Hebrew;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110211:15"/>for the ſake of the Jews who believed. St. <hi>mark</hi> wrote his Goſpel, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> declared it to him. The third is the Goſpel of <hi>Luke,</hi> approved by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and written for the ſake of the Heathens. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                  </q> Had St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeen an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory that <hi>Origen</hi> never ſaw: or would <hi>Origen</hi> have omitted ſuch a Famous Occaſion, and Confirmation of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, when he tells us the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and Approvers of the other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels? The words of <hi>Origen,</hi> before quoted, were extant in his Fourth Book of <hi>Comments on</hi> St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> they are preſerved by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius.</hi> Hiſt. Lib. 6. c. 25. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpends a whole Chapter, concerning the Order of the Evangeliſts; and declares the <hi>true</hi> Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Cauſe of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Writing: which, according to him, was this. It being, ſaith he, obſerved; that the other Evangeliſts had wrote only that part of the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Sayings</hi> of our Saviour, which he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſpoke</hi> after the Impriſonment of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi> To ſupply this Defect, St. <hi>John</hi> was deſired to commit to writing, what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of our Saviour, before the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> was impriſon'd. In a word, he wrote his Goſpel, <hi>to ſupply the Omiſſions of the other Three Evangeliſts.</hi> Euſeb. Lib. 3. c. 24. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> had read <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> and whatever Church-Hiſtory St. <hi>Jerom</hi> could have read; and he has made it his Buſineſs, to make Extracts out of all ancient Books, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writers and Writings of the New Teſtament: the diligence and exactneſs of this Hiſtorian, is much admired and praiſed by all Learned Men; nor will any <hi>ſuch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had ſeen an Ecceſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> had not ſeen. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays, St. <hi>John</hi> wrote to oppoſe the Unitarian Hereſy; and that the firſt words of his Goſpel, were pronounced to him from Heaven. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays, <hi>John</hi> had written his Goſpel, becauſe the other Evangeliſts had omitted the <hi>Geſts</hi> and <hi>Sayings</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that were before the Impriſonment of the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> refers, for what he ſays, to an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all the Ancients but Himſelf. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> proves the Account he gives, by ſolid and convincing Arguments. His words, in the Chapter before quoted, are theſe. <q>It is evident, that the other three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have committed to writing, only the Geſts of our Saviour during one Year's ſpace; namely, after <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut in Priſon. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſets forth the time of his writing, in theſe words; <hi>When Jeſus had heard that</hi> John <hi>was put in Priſon, He came into</hi> Galilee. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith; <hi>Now after that</hi> John <hi>was put in Priſon, Jeſus came into</hi> Galilee. <hi>Luke</hi> alſo maketh this Remark; Herod <hi>adding this to all the Evils he had done, ſhut up</hi> John <hi>in Priſon.</hi> Therefore they ſay, that the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> being for this Cauſe thereto requeſted, has declared in a Goſpel according to him, the time that was paſſed over in ſilence by the other Evangeliſts, and what was done by our Saviour therein.</q> This is a <hi>probable</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; that of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is <hi>Miraculous,</hi> and therefore pleaſes them who are taken with Marvellous things.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay then, that St. <hi>Jerom deviſed,</hi> or that he <hi>dreamt</hi> of an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory; which was never ſeen before nor ſince: neither of them; for I doubt not, that his Tale is nothing elſe but an <hi>Improvement,</hi> and a ſtretch of ſome words of <hi>Clemens Alexander,</hi> which he found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> Lib. 6. c. 14. The words were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> out of <hi>the Inſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Clemens Alexander,</hi> which <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> are now loſt: but <hi>Photius</hi> (Cod. 105, and 111.) has left us this Character of them; that they contained very many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Fabulous and Impious Tales.</hi> Of theſe Tales, this is one; <q>
                     <hi>John,</hi> the laſt of the Evangeliſts, ſeeing that what appertain'd to Chriſt's Humanity, was manifeſted in the other Goſpels; being thereto moved by his Acquaintance, and inſpired by the Spirit, wrote a Goſpel concerning Chriſt's Divinity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:110211:16"/>But to return to our Oppoſers; They commonly ſay, St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Goſpel againſt <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Ebion,</hi> and the Hereſy of the Unitarians: We have ſeen, they have no ſolid ground for this Pretence, in the Hiſtory of the Church; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigon</hi> (the moſt Learned of the Ancients) knew nothing of it; and <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives a contrary Account. But the Goſpel it ſelf, written by St. <hi>John,</hi> will beſt decide this Queſtion: if he has more confirmed this (pretended) Hereſy, than any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Holy Scripture; He did not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, write his Goſpel againſt it. Therefore let us (briefly) ſee, what the Unitarian Doctrine is; and how St. <hi>John</hi> hath delivered his Mind concerning it.</p>
               <p>We ſay; that <hi>only the Father is true God,</hi> that the Lord Chriſt is his Prophet and Meſſenger to Man; that therefore <hi>what the Lord Chriſt ſaid, was not from himſelf,</hi> or by his own Authority, but by particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Charge from God; that all the Miracles he did, were <hi>not properly done by him,</hi> but by the Spirit or Power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given to him, as to former Prophets. Let us hear, how St. <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel, written deſignedly againſt us, confutes this impious Hereſy: John 17.1, 2, 3. <hi>Father,</hi> —<hi>this is Life Eternal, to know thee [the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God] and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> Or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt thy Meſſenger.</hi> John 7.16. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> John 12.49. <hi>The Father which ſent me, He gave me a Commandment what I ſhould ſay.</hi> John 14.31. <hi>As the Father gave me Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo do I.</hi> John 5.30. <hi>I can do nothing of my ſelf.</hi> John 14.10 <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me,</hi> (by his Spirit, Energy or Power) <hi>He doth the Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not what could be ſaid more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, to evince, that the Lord Chriſt is not God, but the Ambaſſador only, and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God; <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> according to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Charge given to him; and <hi>Acting</hi> by a Power (not of his own, but) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, as on former Prophets and Meſſengers of God. If the Texts before cited were not the very words of Scripture; were they found in any other Book, they ſhould be Anathematiz'd as moſt Groſs So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm, as the very Hereſy of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Ebion,</hi> againſt whom (as ſaith St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory) they were written.</p>
               <p>And what wretched Subterfuges do our Oppoſers make uſe of, to decline theſe plain Teſtimonies, that were <hi>ſuggeſted by the Holy Ghoſt againſt them:</hi> for we dare not, like them, feign Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, which ſay, they were ſpoken againſt them from Heaven. Firſt, They tell us; St. <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay, that <hi>only the Father is God,</hi> but <hi>the Father is the only true God.</hi> They ſay, the Socinians have not had the <hi>Wit,</hi> to perceive the <hi>vaſt</hi> difference between thoſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: It may be true, they ſay, and is true, that <hi>the Father is the only true God,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> in the alledged Text ſays; and yet the Son too is true God, nay the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God; and the like of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>John</hi> ſays; neither the <hi>Doctrine</hi> nor the <hi>Actions</hi> of our Saviour were his own; but the Commandments of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given to him, and the Works of the Father dwelling in him: By <hi>the Father</hi> in thoſe Texts, they ſay, we are to underſtand Three Perſons, <hi>the Father,</hi> the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. Nay, when our Saviour ſaith; <hi>Of that Day and Hour</hi> (the Exciſion of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the Diſſolution of the Jewiſh Polity) <hi>none knoweth; not the Angels, neither the Son, but the Father only;</hi> 'Tis not true for all that, that the Father only (or only the Father) knoweth that Day and Hour, for then only the Father were true God; but <hi>the Father only</hi> in thoſe words, is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, but alſo <hi>the Son,</hi> (who is there expreſly denied to know that Day and Hour) and beſides him <hi>the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but however theſe things are, St. <hi>John</hi> has paid us off (they ſay) in his Proem, or firſt Verſes of his Goſpel, in thoſe words which came to him from Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:110211:16"/>But if the Heavenly Words were but honeſtly tranſlated, the Socinians would not fear any Inference that would be drawn from them. Our Proteſtant Oppoſers value themſelves very much on this account, that they have given to the People the holy Bible in the Vulgar Languages: it may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be ſaid, that they have only been more crafty than the Papiſts in impoſing upon the People. The Papiſts have ſillily raiſed againſt themſelves a Clamour for with-holding the Bible from the People, and keeping it lock'd up in only the Learned Languages; and in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they have been conſtrained to tranſlate the Bible, they have been ſo jealous, as to forbid the Commonalty of their Communion the uſe of their own Tranſlations. The Proteſtants have been wiſer, tho not a whit more ſincere; for they have made Tranſlations of the Bible into all Languages, and ſo far have they been from forbidding the uſe of them, that they incourage it with all their Might, well knowing the Benefit that muſt ariſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby; for they know they have printed all the Bibles that are in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Greek Tongue, from only ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript Copies, as <hi>have been corrected</hi> to ſpeak the Language of the Church; and from Bibles ſo corrected and printed, they have made their Tranſlations: nor has the Fraud ſtopp'd here, for whereſoever there is an Ambiguity in the Original Hebrew or Greek, they have always ſo tranſlated, as to confirm their own Doctrines. This was the right method to eſtabliſh their Opinions, not that unjudicious impolitick courſe taken by the Papiſts, which begets ſuſpicion of them, and has therefore been a great means of their Overthrow: there has been nothing ſo plauſibly and effectually urged againſt them, as this, that they have been afraid to let the People have the Word of God, and that their Oppoſers deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nothing more. But if thoſe who boaſt ſo much of this Service done by them to the People, had meant as well, or if they would be owned for Perſons that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the Word of God on their Flocks, they ſhould have put into the Margin of their Tranſlations, thoſe <hi>other Tranſlations</hi> of which (they know) the Original Greek and Hebrew Text is capable, and with thoſe Tranſlarions, the <hi>other Readings</hi> in the Manuſcript Copies. This had been plain dealing: but you muſt excuſe them, 'twould have have hazarded thoſe Remains of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, (and which indeed are the principal parts of Popery) that they thought fit ſtill to retain: thoſe <hi>other Readings</hi> of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Copies, and the <hi>other Tranſlations</hi> of famous Criticks, would have enabled even the common People to perfect <hi>the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> beyond the Standard intended by theſe Tranſlators. The People would have been queſtioning the Doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, Original Sin, the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our Wills to <hi>Evil</hi> only, and other ſuch like Doctrines, againſt which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now ſo much as once open. The Tranſlators were aware, that ſuch a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Edition of our Bibles would have made all Men Divines; becauſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to be able to judg, is not peculiar to Men that know Greek or Latin, but is common and natural to all Mankind, and to every Man, tho he underſtands but one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But 'tis time to give the ſenſe of this ſo much controverted Beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel: I muſt crave leave how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to premiſe this one thing.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Rule of Criticiſm approved, and urged alſo by the Learnedeſt of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers; that the Writers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament have a particular regard to the Notions and Opinious of the Jewiſh Church; as alſo to the Cuſtoms, and Forms of Speech in uſe among that People; ſo that ſuch as happen to be altogether ignorant, either of the Doctrines current among the Jews, or of their Cuſtoms and Forms of ſpeaking; ſuch will ſometimes widely miſtake in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the New Teſtament.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis not ſo eaſy to determine, with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, why the Jews called the Meſſias, whom they expected, the <hi>WORD;</hi> but 'tis evident why St. <hi>John</hi> has been willing to comply with them, in giving that Name to the Meſſias: for as at <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, &amp; 9. he calls our Saviour <hi>the Light,</hi> becauſe he was the Bringer of the Goſpel-light; ſo for the ſame reaſon he is content alſo to call him the <hi>WORD,</hi> becauſe he was the Meſſenger of Glad-Tidings, the Bringer of the Goſpel-Word, or of that new Revelation of the Divine Will, which is indifferently to be called the Goſpel, or the Word of God.</p>
               <p>This reaſon of the Name <hi>the WORD,</hi> given to our Saviour, is obſerved by <hi>Origen,</hi> and after him by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Maldonat, Beza, Gomarus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and other principal Interpreters among our Oppoſers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The WORD was with God, and the WORD was God.</hi> Our Oppoſers themſelves will not deny, becauſe every Novice in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar knows it, that the original words ſhould have been thus rendred, The WORD was with <hi>the</hi> God, and the WORD was <hi>a</hi> God. We claim this Tranſlation as abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for clearing the meaning of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt in this place. He ſaith not, the Word was <hi>with God,</hi> but with <hi>the</hi> God; becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (or <hi>the</hi> God) is always uſed to ſignify the true God, or him who is God <hi>by way of Excellence and Appropriation,</hi> as Grammarians ſpeak: but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>a</hi> God, is in Holy Scripture applied to Angels, to Kings, to Prophets, and to all ſuch as any way repreſent the Perſon of him who is indeed God. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> is called and named <hi>a</hi> God, and that by God himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. becauſe he was to repreſent the Perſon, and bring the Commands or Word of God to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Egypt. Moſes</hi> being called (by Coufeſſion of our Oppoſers) <hi>a</hi> God, on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110211:17"/>the fore-mentioned account; we ought not to be ſurprized, that this Evangeliſt has called <hi>the WORD,</hi> or Meſſias, <hi>a</hi> God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had the very ſame reaſon to call him ſo, that there was for <hi>Moſes</hi> his being ſo called; for the Meſſias was no leſs than <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Ambaſſador and Repreſentative of God, and that alſo not to one or two Nations, but to all Mankind.</p>
               <p>But whereas he is here ſaid to be (or have been) with <hi>the</hi> God; the meaning is, that before he entred on his Office, he was taken up into Heaven, to be fully inſtructed and informed in the nature and quality of his Office, and of that whole Charge which he was to deliver to Men. 'Tis in vain here, that our preſent Oppoſer Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> demands, after a ſcoffing manner, at what time <hi>this</hi> Aſſumption into Heaven did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; 'tis enough that we are told the thing by this Evangeliſt, and by our Saviour; we are not obliged to gueſs at the time, which the Scriptures have thought ſit to conceal. The thing it ſelf is plainly enough intimated in divers Texts of this Evangeliſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>No Man hath aſcended into Heaven, but he that is come down from Heaven; even the Son of Man, who WAS in Heaven.</hi> So that Text is tranſlated by <hi>Beza, Eraſmus, Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius,</hi> and other Criticks. <hi>John</hi> 6.62. <hi>What if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where be was before?</hi> John 8.38. <hi>I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father.</hi> See alſo <hi>John</hi> 6.38, 51. It is true, the Evangeliſts have not recorded the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Time or Hiſtory of our Saviour's <hi>firſt</hi> Aſſumption unto God, as they have of his Transfiguration, his ſecond Aſſumption, and other remarkable Paſſages of his Life: but the reaſon of that is, becauſe they were Eye-witneſſes of the <hi>latter,</hi> but the <hi>other</hi> happened before they were called to be Diſciples, or to attend on him; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never (as it ſhould ſeem) told them of it, but only hinted it in ſome Diſcourſes and Defences which he made to his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers. You ſee, Sir, there is no need of a <hi>Chimerical</hi> and imaginary, <hi>perpetual and continual Generation of the Son,</hi> nor yet of an impoſſible <hi>mutual In-being</hi> of the Father and Son, for our underſtanding theſe words, <hi>the WORD was with God:</hi> the Difficulty is ſolved, after a <hi>natural and intelligible</hi> way; for the WORD was indeed <hi>with</hi> God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was taken up into Heaven, to be informed of all thigns appertaining to <hi>the Goſpel-Diſpenſation;</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was called up into the Mountain, to be inſtructed in the Particulars of <hi>the Legal Diſpenſation;</hi> and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to have Revelations and Viſions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Apoſtle of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Our Oppoſers do not find what to object to this Explication of the words, <hi>the WORD was with God;</hi> but to the other Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the WORD was called <hi>a</hi> God, in the ſame ſenſe only (or chiefly) that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo called at <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, this Evaſion of the Socinians is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by the Deſcription which St. <hi>John</hi> here adds, for he deſcribes the WORD to be God, or <hi>a</hi> God, not as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation and Miſſion, but becauſe <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made; and becauſe the World was made by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a bold Tranſlation, they ſhould at leaſt have ſignified in the Margin, that the words might have been rendred; <hi>For him were all things made, and without reſpect to him there was nothing made that was made; the World was made for him.</hi> They know very well, I make Challenge to them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, that the Greek Prepoſition which they have rendred <hi>by,</hi> might have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>for;</hi> ſo as to make the ſenſe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid even this, <hi>For</hi> him were all things made, the World was made <hi>for</hi> him. There is no Greek Lexicon but owns this Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Prepoſition, when 'tis put (as here) before a Genitive.</p>
               <p>'Tis enough to determine us which of the aforeſaid Tranſlations we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; that we know 'twas the Belief of the Jews, and is a moſt certain and undeniable Truth, that <hi>all things were made for the Meſſias;</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:110211:18"/>that is, were at firſt made with intention to ſubject them in the fulneſs of Time, to the Meſſias and his Law, <hi>both</hi> which God <hi>decreed</hi> before he actually made the World. But we have beſides for it this irrefragable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; that 'tis certain, there is but one Creator, and the one Creator is no other but God: ſeeing therefore the WORD is here diſtinguiſhed from <hi>the</hi> God, (and thereby denied to be <hi>the</hi> God) we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to tranſlate here, All things were made <hi>for</hi> him, the World was made <hi>for</hi> him; not the World was made <hi>by</hi> him, or all things <hi>by</hi> him.</p>
               <p>I ſay, we are obliged thus to tranſlate, or this Tranſlation is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> on ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks here of the <hi>old</hi> or firſt Creation, and the <hi>viſible</hi> or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial World. But the Socinians have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuppoſed, that he ſpeaks here of the <hi>new</hi> Creation and the <hi>Spiritual</hi> World; even that great Change of Affairs in the World, which hath been ſo conſiderable, that the Scriptures have divers times called it <hi>the New Heavens and the New Earth,</hi> as has been ſhown on <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10, 11. If theſe are the <hi>All things,</hi> and this <hi>the World</hi> intended by St. <hi>John;</hi> we admit the Tranſlation of our Oppoſers, that All things were made by the WORD: for 'twas by his Miniſtry, that great Change of Affairs, called by the Jews, <hi>the World of the Meſſias,</hi> was effected. If to this Interpretation, it be objected, that 'tis not very likely, that this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt would lay ſuch an occaſion of Error in our way, as to ſay, all things were made <hi>by</hi> the WORD, and the World was made <hi>by</hi> him, if the WORD were not indeed the Maker of the World: becauſe very few would apprehend that he ſpoke of a new Creation; and I know not what <hi>World of the Meſſias.</hi> I confeſs the Objection is weighty, but it may be (reaſonably) anſwered, that the <hi>New</hi> Creation, the <hi>Spiritual</hi> World, and the World of the Meſſias, was ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known to the Jews, and alſo to the Chriſtians of thoſe Times, who were all converted by Jewiſh Preachers, that St. <hi>John</hi> reaſonably expected to be readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them. Eſpecially conſidering, that but one God, and one only Creator, was then ſo well known to be the Doctrine of Chriſtianity and of Judaiſm; that no one, who was at all acquainted with thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, would underſtand a Writer of either of thoſe Perſwaſions, of any other Creation or World, but the World of the Meſſias and the new Creation, when he attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Creation or World to any Perſon but God. In a word, St. <hi>John</hi> ſuppoſed; that he ſpoke ſafely and intelligibly, becauſe writing his Goſpel for the uſe of Jews and Chriſtians, who knew the Doctrines of the Jewiſh Church concerning the Meſſias; ſuch muſt needs perfectly underſtand of what World he ſpake, when he ſhould ſay, <hi>the World was made by the WORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſhort is, either St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks here of the <hi>old</hi> Creation, and the <hi>viſible</hi> World, and then we ought to render his words, All things were made <hi>for</hi> him, the World was made <hi>for</hi> him; which is an Alluſion to a known ſaying of the Jews, that <hi>the World was made for the Meſſias,</hi> namely, to ſubject it (in the fulneſs of Time) to the Meſſias and his Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> great and certain Truth: Or, he ſpeaks of the <hi>new</hi> Creation, and the World which all Men expected the Meſſias ſhould make; and if ſo, we underſtand him as ſaying, All things were made <hi>by</hi> him, and the World was made <hi>by</hi> him.</p>
               <p>The reſt is eaſy; <hi>The WORD was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us.</hi> And, <hi>He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not be denied, Sir, by any of our Oppoſers, that inſtead of <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> (that is, ſay they, was made <hi>Man</hi>) we may render the Greek by <hi>the Word WAS Fleſh,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>was Man,</hi> or <hi>a</hi> Man. The Greek Word which, to ſerve the preſent turn, they render here by <hi>was made,</hi> is by themſelves in this very Chapter rendred <hi>WAS,</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>There WAS a Man ſent from God, whoſe Name was</hi> John.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:110211:18"/>'Tis plain enough, why our Oppoſers would take no notice, that St. <hi>John</hi>'s words might be rendred <hi>the Word WAS Fleſh;</hi> or, <hi>was a Man, and dwelt among us:</hi> for this Tranſlation would have turned the whole Context againſt them. It would have been perceived by All, that when the Word is before called <hi>a</hi> God, the meaning muſt be, he is a God as he repreſented the true God; and becauſe (like <hi>Moſes,</hi> who on the ſame Account is called <hi>a</hi> God, at <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1.) he is the Ambaſſador and Meſſenger of God, the bringer of the Commands and Word of God. Men would have diſcerned too, that they muſt not interpret St. <hi>John,</hi> as ſaying that the World (the Viſible World) and All things were made <hi>by</hi> the WORD, but only <hi>for</hi> the WORD: Nay, this Tranſlation, <hi>the WORD was a Man,</hi> would have contradicted them Directly and Expreſly; for though they ſay Jeſus Chriſt was a Man, yet <hi>the WORD</hi> (to which He was perſonally united) was <hi>God,</hi> and not Man, according to them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> has teſtified of <hi>the WORD;</hi> He is preferred before me, for <hi>He was before me.</hi> Here again the Tranſlators have favoured themſelves, by rendring the Greek words <hi>WAS before me;</hi> they might have been rendred, <hi>IS before me:</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Tranſlation, <hi>Was before me; Eraſmus, Grotius, Beza, Maldonat,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crities obſerve, that the words are to be underſtood, of <hi>a priority of Dignity,</hi> not a priority of <hi>Time;</hi> ſo as to make this Senſe, He is preferred before me, thô in regard of Time I am before Him, becauſe He was indeed before me in Excellence of Merit, and Dignity of Perſon and Office.</p>
               <p>It is a very common thing with our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, to pretend, that the Socinians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paraphraſe this beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, without making ſuch an <hi>harſh</hi> ſenſe, as is next to ridiculous: therefore let us put all that has been ſaid, into one view, in this following Paraphraſe; and do you, Sir, and all Men judg, whether it be Harſh or Uncouth. <q>
                     <hi>In the beginning</hi> of the Goſpel-State, was the Meſſiah; whom the Jews have uſed to call <hi>the WORD:</hi> and we alſo may ſo call him, becauſe He is the Great Meſſenger and Preacher of the Goſpel-Word. This WORD was aſſumed into Heaven, and was there <hi>with God;</hi> to be inſtructed in all that he was to <hi>ſay</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> in the execution of the Office of the Meſſiah. He was with <hi>the</hi> God; and He himſelf was <hi>a</hi> God, being to repreſent the Perſon of God as his Ambaſſador, and to deliver his Commands and Word to Men: On which account very Many, and particularly <hi>Moſes,</hi> are called Gods in Holy Scripture. The Meſſias was decreed before the World was; nay, the World was at firſt made, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſubject it, in the fulneſs of Time, to the Meſſias and his Law: So that <hi>the World,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> may be ſaid, to have been made <hi>for</hi> him; and that <hi>without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or regard had to him, nothing was made that was made.</hi> Yet as Great a Perſon as the Meſſias is, this is always to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that <hi>He was Fleſh,</hi> or Man, Man like to us, and that dwelt among us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I will ſay no more of him, at this time, but this; that <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> whom all Men took to be a Prophet, bore this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of him: That thô the WORD came after him, in reſpect of Time; yet the WORD <hi>was indeed before him,</hi> in the Excellence of his Perſon, the Dignity of his Office, and the Miraculous Power over Diſeaſes and Devils, beſtowed on him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is there, Sir, in all this Paraphraſe, that is not intelligible and eaſy? And for its Agreement with the Greek Text of St. <hi>John,</hi> we prove it by Rules of Criticiſm, not only not deniable by our Oppoſers, but advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and urged by themſelves.</p>
               <p>It all depends upon theſe two Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sometimes ſuch as are meer Men, are, on the account of their Deputation and Miſſion from God, honoured with the Name of God: which we prove by the Example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (the Lawgiver of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110211:19"/>as the Lord Chriſt is of the New) and from the Mouth of our Saviour himſelf, at <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may be rendred by the Engliſh words <hi>For</hi> and <hi>Was:</hi> which we ſhow by all the Greek Lexicons, and by their own Tranſlations of other Texts of Seripture.</p>
               <p>Our Oppoſers alledg this Context, as the principal Evidence they have to produce, that there is more than one Divine Perſon, and more than one who is Creator of the World: We anſwer, we are taught in the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Commandments, that there is <hi>but one who is God,</hi> and <hi>but one Maker</hi> of the Viſible and Material World; and therefore this Context ought to be interpreted, in conſiſtence with thoſe two Great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſpoken by God himſelf. Sure it muſt be evident hereupon, that they ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on a <hi>dubious</hi> Context, againſt two ſuch Proofs as are thoſe two Commandments. When Points of Faith are turned into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments or Laws, it argues the great Importance of thoſe Articles of our Faith: And it muſt needs be very <hi>dangerous</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a contrary Faith, and very <hi>fooliſh</hi> to advance a contrary Faith on the Credit of a Context, which at beſt is of doubtful and uncertain Conſtruction; of ſo doubtful Conſtruction, that if it may be Tranſlated and Interpreted, in favour of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it may be alſo ſo Rendred and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, as <hi>Flatly</hi> to contradict it, and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> deſtroy and overthrow it.</p>
               <p>You will perhaps ſay, Sir; but in this Diſpute concerning the Truth of Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, What can an Unlearned Man do; which ſide can he take? or rather, How can he take any Side at all; being not able to judg between the contending Parties? ought he not in prudence, wholly to ſuſpend his Judgment?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; He muſt conſult his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> concerning the thing in Queſtion. If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults his own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> he will find an abſolute Impoſſibility in the Trinitarian Doctrine; his Reaſon will aſſure him, that an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Father, and an Almighty Son, are moſt certainly Two Gods; and that <hi>two</hi> Creators can be no other but two Gods: therefore he may, and he muſt infer; that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Context of St. <hi>John,</hi> which advances ſuch a Doctrine, is certainly falſe, and ſuch a Miſtake as ſubverts Chriſtianity. God forbid, that our Faith ſhould depend, on the Quarrels and Debates of Learned Men; or on an uncertain Criticiſm; or on the <hi>contrary Traditions</hi> of contending Parties: No no, Faith has a certain Rule, even <hi>Holy Scripture interpreted in conſistence with evident Reaſon;</hi> this is the Infallible Rule, and of this the Unlearned are as competent Judges, as he that has all the Learning in the World. That cannot be true, which is contrary to clear Reaſon; for <hi>Clear Reaſon is nothing elſe but clear Truth:</hi> Therefore if the Unitarians have made it appear, that the Doctrines which they oppoſe, are Manifeſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to Reaſon; and Unlearned Man is as ſure as the moſt Learned, that ſuch Doctrines are not the meaning of Holy Scripture, or of any Context therein.</p>
               <p>Our Oppoſers tell the People, they are not to believe the Tranſubſtantiation, tho grounded on thoſe expreſs Words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> becauſe that Doctrine implies ſeveral Contradictions to clear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Why do they not keep to this Rule, to which they would oblige their People? Why do they not renounce the Errors of the Trinity and Incarnation, which imply ſo many more Contradictions to Reaſon, than can be pretended of the Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? While they argue againſt the Common Enemy the Papiſts, about Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> about Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantion; Reaſon is all in all with them, and you can get nothing out of them, but <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and the Judgment of <hi>Senſe:</hi> But when the Diſpute is with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Tables are turned; then you hear nothing from them, but the neceſſity of ſubmitting <hi>Reaſon</hi> to Revelation; then they give <hi>in</hi> their Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of things, which (they ſay) are contradictory to our Reaſon, and yet muſt be believed. Thus while they Argue againſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110211:19"/>the Papiſts, 'tis <hi>on Socinian Principles,</hi> that the Scripture muſt be interpreted in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence with Evident <hi>Reaſon;</hi> which is a yielding all the Controverted Points to the Socinians: But when they think fit to fall foul on the Socinians, 'tis <hi>on Popiſh Principles,</hi> that the Scripture muſt be interpreted by the Determinations and Deciſions of Holy Mother-Church, as ſhe is repreſented in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, which are directed by the Holy Ghoſt: Which implies the yielding Tranſubſtantiation, and many other Points, to the Papiſts, who can ſhow for them Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils as truly General, as any that can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the Trinity or Incarnation.</p>
               <p>In fine, ſuch of our Oppoſers as are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> muſt either come over <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to <hi>Rome:</hi> If they will not be obliged to interpret Scripture by Reaſon, they are obliged to turn Papiſts; for the Deciſions of the Church in Councils, and <hi>the meer Letter of Scripture,</hi> are againſt them: but if they admit no Interpretation of Scripture, but what is conſiſtent with Reaſon, both They and the Papiſts muſt be Unitarians, becauſe the Trinity and the Incarnation are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>to,</hi> and inconſiſtent <hi>with</hi> Reaſon, much more than the Tranſubſtantiation is.</p>

               <p>A little more Deference would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Author, in making a Judgment, concerning what our Saviour or his Apoſtles ought to have done, towards rectifying the Miſtakes of the Jews: And I think too, he needed not to be ſo concerned, on behalf of the poor Innocent Lambs the Jews; who only miſtook (true Hearts,) and did not deſignedly pervert the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. On the contrary, I take it to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that the Miſtake of the Jews, was not Involuntary, but Affected and Malicious; and however that be, yet our Saviour hath ſaid enough, both in that Context and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to rectify the Miſtakes of any whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, concerning his words, <hi>I and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one; I am the Son of God; the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Oppoſers ordinarily object to us; that the Jews underſtood thoſe Expreſſions of our Saviour, as themſelves do: namely, as ſignifying, that he profeſſed himſelf to be God. But the Jews put a malicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on our Saviour's words; that they might expoſe him to <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Perſecution.</hi> To be ſatisfied of this, we need only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they came to him, with deſign to enſnare him in his words; as they had done oft-times before, and did many times afterwards. Let us hear what they ſay, <hi>v.</hi> 24. Then came the Jews round about him, and ſaid to him; <hi>How long doſt thou make us to doubt? if thou be the Chriſt, tell us plainly.</hi> To comprehend the true meaning of their putting this Queſtion, we muſt look back to the foregoing Chapter, where, at <hi>V.</hi> 22.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110211:20"/>we are told, <hi>The Jews had agreed already, that if any Man ſhould confeſs, that He</hi> (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) <hi>was the Chriſt, He ſhould be put out of the Synagogue: i. e.</hi> He ſhould be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. We may add to this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that by the Conſtitutions of that Church, every Perſon profeſſing himſelf to be a Prophet, and not being really ſo, was to be put to death; much more if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the Great Prophet of all, the Meſſiah or Chriſt. I ſay now, ſeeing they ſo perfectly perſwaded themſelves, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was not the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that they reſolved to Excommunicate any of their own Number, who ſhould acknowledg him for the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> 'tis evident enough, that their Queſtion, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt?</hi> was <hi>inſidious,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to get ſomething from his own Mouth, on which they might Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him; nay, and proceed againſt him as a falſe Pretender, to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Can any one wonder, or reaſonably doubt, that ſuch Perſons put a malicious Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the words of his Anſwer to them? And is it for Chriſtians, to draw Arguments, nay, <hi>build Articles of Faith</hi> on the ſenſe that ſuch Perſons made of our Saviour's words? and yet this is the great Argument of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, from this Context; The Jews, ſay they, underſtood our Saviour as ſaying, that He was God. Why do They not take notice, that the Jews aſſembled about him for no other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to find Occaſion againſt him, either by his own expreſs Words, or by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they could make of his Words?</p>
               <p>But they ſay farther; our Saviour did not rectify the Miſtake of the Jews. I know not, how it would help the Cauſe of our Oppoſers; if indeed it were ſo, that our Saviour had left the Jews in the hands of their own Malice, without caring to anſwer their groundleſs Cavils; provided He hath been careful, clearly to explain his Meaning to his Diſciples, or others who in time to come might (happily) miſtake him. But the Truth is, He doth in this very Context deny the Calumny of the Jews, that He made Himſelf (ſo 'tis in the Original) <hi>a</hi> God. For He anſwers them at <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the World; Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I faid, I am the Son of God?</hi> The Unicarians may argue as <hi>ſtrongly,</hi> from this Anſwer of our Saviour, as their Oppoſers have argued <hi>weakly,</hi> from the malicious Conſtruction that his Adverſaries made of his former words, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>weak</hi> Argument, to ſay, The Lord Chriſt is true God, for his Inveterate Adverſaries (who ſought his Life) charged him with making himſelf <hi>a</hi> God: But we reaſon Unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when we ſay, the Lord Chriſt is the Meſſenger whom God has ſent into the World, and not God himſelf; becauſe He replies to the Jews, that God ſanctified him indeed, and ſent him into the World; and that He had never ſaid of himſelf any higher thing, than this which is true of every good Man, <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not now enter into a particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, what is the very Meaning of that <hi>whole</hi> Defence, which our Saviour hore makes of himſelf in this Context; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that neither the Trinitarians nor Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians have hitherto comprehended all that our Saviour intended to ſay: But 'tis not neceſſary to inquire into a Matter, that will require a very long Diſcourſe to clear it; becauſe elſewhere our Saviour has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted all the Expreſſions, to which the Jews excepted, and at which others have ſo dangerouſly ſtumbled. They are theſe Three, <hi>I and my Father are one; I am the Son of God; the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> He ſaith as much of his Diſciples; and explains to us, what we are to underſtand by the words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22. <hi>The Glory which thou gaveſt me,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Glory, or Honour of being the Ambaſſador of God to Men) <hi>I have given to them,</hi> (to my Diſciples) <hi>that they may be One, as we are One.</hi> Here our Lord declares to us, theſe Three Points; that He is One with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that He hath made his Diſciples alſo, to be One with the Father, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and in what regard it is, that He and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110211:20"/>They are one with the Father; not by an <hi>Oneneſs,</hi> or Unity of Perſon, as the Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans held; nor by an Oneneſs of Nature or Godhead, as the Trinitarians hold; but by ſuch an Unity or Oneneſs as is between the <hi>Sinder</hi> and the <hi>Sent,</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> and his <hi>Principal;</hi> namely, an Oneneſs of <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Intention:</hi> For the ſenſe of our Saviour there is plainly this; As thou haſt made me to be one with thy ſelf, even a Partner and Sharer in the ſame Deſign, the Deſign of reconciſing Men to God; ſo have I made my Diſciples to be one with us both, and with one another, by ſubſtituting them in my Place, and by imploying and ingaging them in the ſame Deſign. Again, he ſaith at <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Keep thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be out, as we are.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, As thou Father and I are one, by our <hi>Mutual Love;</hi> ſo keep Thoſe whom thou haſt given me, in a like Unity, both with Us and among Themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus it is then, that our Saviour is one with the Father (that is, with God) by an Oneneſs of Affection and Love, and by an Oneneſs of Deſign and Intention: and he reaches us at the ſame time, that there is the ſame Unity or Oneneſs, not only between the Father and Himſelf on the one part, and all faithful Diſciples on the other part; but alſo among the Faithful themſelves.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having given us theſe <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Senſes of his words, <hi>I and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one;</hi> the Socinians acquieſce in them, without erecting impoſſible and impious Schemes, ſuch as an Unity of more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one and the ſame numerical God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; they leave thoſe things to ſuch as are not contented with Scripture-Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or with a Faith which is Rational, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible and Plain, but muſt have <hi>Myſteries</hi> to amaze and confound their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as if <hi>Faith</hi> were nothing but Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or Brutality, whereas the Apoſtle (on the contrary) defines or deſcribes it to be <hi>Evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> It is true, but he prays that all the Faithful may have the ſame Privilege, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. <hi>I pray—that they all may be one, at thou, Father, art in me, and I in ther; that they may be one in us.</hi> And the Criticks have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this following <hi>reading</hi> in ancient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, at <hi>John</hi> 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him; as the Father is in me, and I in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Why and in what ſenſe our Saviour ſaith, He was <hi>in</hi> the Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in</hi> Him; and in what regard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, He deſires and prays; that all ſuch as believe in his Name, may be one <hi>in</hi> Him and <hi>in</hi> the Father, is explained by this Evangeliſt, in his firſt Epiſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. <hi>He that keepeth his</hi> (God's) <hi>Commandments, dwelleth in Him; and He in him.</hi> 1 John 4.16. <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour therefore, and all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> the Father or God, by their <hi>Obedlinet</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and God is in them, by his mutual Love to them. This is the Interpretation which the Scripture gives of it ſelf; we ought not to heed the Dreams or Fancies of <hi>Myſtical</hi> Divines, who think nothing is Religion, but what no body underſtands, and what contradicts Reaſon and good Senſe.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, our Saviour alſo ſaid, <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi> Every one confeſſes that he was ſo, becauſe he was generated by the Divine Power, on a Virgin, without the Concurrence of any other Father but God; yet even this, as great a matter as it is, is not ſo great a Glory to him, as that he was the Son of God in ſuch ſenſe, as all the Faithful are called God's <hi>Children,</hi> Sons and Daughters of God, begotten of God; namely, becauſe of their Similitude and Likeneſs to God in Holineſs or Purity, to which they have been <hi>begotten</hi> by him, by his Word, and other Means ſutable and adapted to their Rational Natures. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> 1 John 5.18. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not; he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:110211:21"/>Whereas therefore the Lord Chriſt is ſometimes called <hi>the only begotten</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is to be underſtood, as when <hi>Iſaac</hi> is called the <hi>only</hi> Son, and <hi>the only begotten</hi> Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> at <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Abraham</hi> had other Sons begotten by himſelf, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> is called his <hi>only begotten</hi> in regard of his Father's <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Love to him, even ſuch as Parents uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually have for an only Child. And in this ſenſe the Greek word (uſed concerning our Saviour) which we render <hi>only begotten,</hi> is frequently uſed in Greek Authors, and not only of ſuch Perſon or Perſons, as are ſtrictly and in proper ſpeaking <hi>only begotten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Interpretations of the objected Clauſes, <hi>I and the Father are one; I am the Son of God; the Father is in me, and I in him;</hi> we have the concurring Judgment of the principal Criticks and Interpreters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Trinitarians: ſome of them do blame the Fathers for urging ſuch Scripture-Expreſſions as theſe, againſt the Arians and Photinians; and they call the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fathers, and of ſome Modern Writers of Controverſies, <hi>Violent Gloſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our preſent Oppoſer was aware of this, and therefore is forced to ſay at <hi>P.</hi> 354. <hi>We are not bound to regard what ſome Men of great Names ſay, or boldly aſſert:</hi> It is true, but the Authority of ſuch Men whoſe Names are (deſervedly) great in Critical Learning, and eſpecially in the <hi>ſacred Criticiſm,</hi> doth at leaſt evince thus much, that the Texts which <hi>They</hi> give up to their Oppoſers, ought to be placed in a Claſs by themſelves, they ought to be reckoned among the Proofs that are brought for <hi>ſhow,</hi> and Oſtentation of Number, or to fill up the ſpare Pages of a Book, or in a popular Sermon, not in ſuch a Book, wherein the Author profeſſes to deal only with the Learned, and to urge no other Text but what is indeed an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his behalf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſhort</hi> is, our Oppoſers litigate with us concerning the ſenſe of theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>I and the Father are one; God is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I am in the Father, and the Father in me:</hi> We ſhow hereupon, from expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that all theſe things are true of all the Faithful, and are ſaid of them, no leſs than of our Saviour: We ſhow farther, that they are interpreted in Holy Scripture, to be an <hi>Oneneſs</hi> of Deſign and Love, an <hi>In-Being</hi> by Obedience and Love on the part of the Lord Chriſt and Believers, and of Protection and Love on the part of God; and that the Lord Chriſt may be ſo the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and his <hi>only Begotten,</hi> as that ſtill he is but a <hi>Man,</hi> and not <hi>God:</hi> We ſhow that all this is confeſt, tho not by the <hi>wrangling</hi> Pulpit, and <hi>trifling</hi> Syſtematicks and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts; yet by the chief Interpreters and Criticks, and firſt Reformers, even among our Oppoſers themſelves. On the contrary, thoſe that interpret the before-mentioned Expreſſions of our Saviour, as if in them he meant to ſay, that he is <hi>God;</hi> ſuch do advance an Interpretation that deſtroys the Unity of God, contradicts manifeſt Reaſon, and has no Vouchers but the <hi>Jews;</hi> I ſay, none but the Jews; for Trinitarians can produce no Text of Scripture, nor any Profane Author that can poſſibly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean by ſuch Expreſſions what they mean, namely, <hi>a numerical Oneneſs of Nature, an In-being by Mixture of Perſons, and a Natural Generation out of the very Eſſence of God.</hi> Upon theſe Texts therefore we have as much advantage againſt them, as poſſibly we can have, even Reaſon, the Current of Scripture, the Authority of their own Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and of all Profane Writers.</p>
               <p>The next Trouble he gives us out of the New Teſtament, is, from <hi>John</hi> 20.28. Thomas <hi>anſwered, and ſaid unto him</hi> (unto Jeſus) <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi>

                  <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, <hi>Wolzogenius</hi> and <hi>Slichtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> learned Unitarians, do not only grant, but they contend, that it was indeed the Intention of <hi>Thomas,</hi> to call our Saviour his <hi>Lord,</hi> and his <hi>God;</hi> but 'tis in no other ſenſe than the Author of the 45th Pſalm, calls <hi>Solomon God; Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> To which he adds, ſpeaking to

And ſo alſo St. <hi>Jerome</hi> tranſlates, <hi>Ipſe eſt Dominus Deus taus, &amp; adorabunt eum:</hi> but the Tranſlators imployed by King <hi>James,</hi> have left out the word <hi>God,</hi> from thoſe words to the Queen, <hi>He is the Lord thy God.</hi> But ſeeing <hi>Solomon</hi> had before been called God, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever;</hi> 'tis undeniable that in this Pſalm he is called both <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God;</hi> and his Queen is bid to <hi>worſhip</hi> him, that is, to honour him; for ſuch was the Language of the Eaſtern Nations to their Kings, and Perſons in Eminent Dignity. The Prophets <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> are called <hi>Elobim,</hi> or God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.11, 13, 14. In that laſt Context, King <hi>Saul</hi> ordered the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to call up <hi>Samuel;</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe called to <hi>Saul</hi> and told him, that now ſhe ſaw <hi>Elohim</hi> (God) aſcending up. <hi>Saul</hi> thereupon asks her, <hi>What form is he of?</hi> the Woman replies, <hi>He is an old Man.</hi> It appears by this, that beſides their Kings and Magiſtrates, the Jews gave alſo the Name <hi>Elohim</hi> to the Prophets. But that was the very word uſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Thomas</hi> to our Saviour; the Greeks tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Engliſh by the word <hi>God.</hi> Therefore when 'tis uſed of a <hi>Man,</hi> we are not to ſuppoſe, that the Speaker in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to call ſuch Man <hi>God;</hi> or that he owns him for a Perſon who is <hi>true God;</hi> but he uſes it in ſuch ſenſe, as the Jews and other Eaſtern Nations uſed it; for a Perſon of Eminent Dignity, or worth. The Woman ſaid of <hi>Samuel,</hi> then riſing out of the Earth, I ſee <hi>Elohim, God: Thomas</hi> ſays of our Saviour, newly alſo riſen, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, my God, my God;</hi> they both uſe the ſame word, and one no more than the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to call the Perſon of whom he ſpake, <hi>the true God,</hi> but only a venerable, or dignified Perſon. To be ſhort, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words <hi>El</hi> and <hi>Elohim,</hi> the Syriac and Chaldaic <hi>Elohi, Eloi,</hi> and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all which we render by the Engliſh <hi>God,</hi> are words of juſt ſuch a Latitude in Holy Scripture, and among the Jews and other Oriental Nations, as the word <hi>LORD,</hi> is with us; for we uſe that word indifferently, ſometimes of God, ſometimes of Perſons in Dignity, and leave our meaning to be judged by the true and known Quality of the Perſon to whom we ſpeak. We do not think or fear we ſhall be underſtood, as making a Man to be God, becauſe we call him by a Name by which alſo we call God. This is the very caſe before us, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays to our Saviour <hi>Eloi,</hi> a Name uſed of God and of Perſons in Dignity; and he expected not to be miſtaken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon to whom he ſpoke was known to be a <hi>Man,</hi> and not <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>likely</hi> the before-mentioned is the true Interpretation of the objected Texts; and 'tis certainly ſo, if <hi>Thomas</hi> meant thoſe words to our Saviour: But divers Learned Perſons, even among our Oppoſers, have been of Opinion, that <hi>My Lord, and my God</hi> (or, O my Lord! O my God!) are only words of Admiration and Thanks di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected (not to our Saviour, but) to God; they are an <hi>Exclamation,</hi> expreſſing the Apoſtle's Wonder and Amazement to find that his Maſter was indeed riſen.

               <p>HE thinks much weight may be laid on Rom. 9.5. <hi>Of whom, as concerning the Fleſh, Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Like to which Text is <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who was made of the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>according to the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith hereupon, that theſe words, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh,</hi> and, <hi>as concerning the Fleſh,</hi> intimate plainly, that <hi>according to ſomething elſe</hi> the Lord Chriſt had another Original, and was not <hi>wholly</hi> of the Jews. This <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> is the (ſuppoſed) Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of our Saviour; according to which, ſay they, he is derived from God; as <hi>according to the Fleſh,</hi> he is from the Jews.</p>
               <p>Our preſent Author notes farther, that the Lord Chriſt in the former of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Texts, is not only expreſly called <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>God over all, bleſſed for evermore;</hi> ſo all the Original Greek Copies read. And as for Tranſlations, if there are any which favour the Socinians, they are not however much to be regarded. I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the words, <hi>As concerning the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>According to the Fleſh,</hi> they never ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, as Trinitarians would here interpret, <hi>according to the Human Nature,</hi> as if Chriſt had alſo a Divine Nature. We ſhall eaſily find the meaning of thoſe Phraſes, by ſome other Texts of Scripture, in which there is no Ambiguity: Rom. 9.3. <hi>My Kinſmen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh.</hi> Rom. 4.1. Abraham <hi>our Father, as pertaining to the Fleſh.</hi> Col. 3.22. <hi>Servants, obey in all things your Maſters according to the Fleſh.</hi> Will our Oppoſers ſay here, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi>'s Kinſmen, or Maſters, muſt be ſuppoſed to have a Divine Nature, becauſe of theſe words, <hi>According to the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>As concerning the Fleſh?</hi> 'Tis eaſy to ſee, that theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are only as much as to ſay, <hi>According to the Body;</hi> and that they ſignify to us, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Father of the Jews, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Bodies,</hi> as God is the Father of their Souls and Spirits; and the Jews were <hi>Paul</hi>'s Kinſmen, <hi>according to the Body,</hi> but not of Kin to him in reſpect of <hi>Likeneſs in Faith or Manners:</hi> alſo that Maſters are Maſters over our Bodies, not of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Minds. Therefore in the other Texts alſo, where Chriſt is ſaid to be the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>David, according to the Fleſh:</hi> the real and whole meaning is this, That according to his Body or <hi>outward Man,</hi> he deſcended of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and of the Stock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> as had been promiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him in the Prophets, but his Spirit or Soul was from God. Here again we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture by it ſelf: let our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers ſhew a Reaſon why they decline an Interpretation which the Scripture it ſelf affords to us, and how it comes to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, to underſtand the meaning of one Text, by the help of ſuch other Texts as are confeſt to be clear and evident?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, the former of theſe Texts expreſly calls the Lord Chriſt <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever;</hi> and that all Greek Copies agree in this reading. But he might have taken notice out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the Greek Copies uſed by the Author of the Syriac, had not the word <hi>God;</hi> they only ſay of our Saviour here, <hi>the Bleſſed, over all.</hi> The ſame illuſtrious Interpreter obſerves, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> had noted, that the Copies of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> had only <hi>the Bleſſed over all,</hi> or above all, without the word <hi>God.</hi> Theſe are Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which deſtroy our Author's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from this Text; but becauſe he knew
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110211:22"/>not what to ſay to them, he took no notice of them: But it is an impious thing for a Writer, to endeavour to <hi>cheat</hi> his Reader in ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as theſe. When it appears by ſo great Authorities, that the Antient Reading was <hi>other ways</hi> than we read in our preſent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies; or that the reading was then <hi>various</hi> and <hi>uncertain;</hi> how can ſuch Texts, or ſuch Expreſſions be admitted <hi>as Proofs,</hi> in ſo great a Queſtion as this before us? Is it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable or ſafe, to argue againſt the Unity of God, or to build Articles of Faith on <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected</hi> Texts? the Reading ought to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable,</hi> elſe the Inference drawn from it, will alſo be <hi>uncertain.</hi> An Article of Faith muſt have a ſure Foundation, elſe 'tis not <hi>Faith,</hi> but a <hi>precarious Conjecture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But allowing now, that the Word <hi>God</hi> is rightly read in this Text; two of the moſt eminent Critics, and principal Maſters in the Greek Tongue, have obſerved, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words ſhould have been <hi>pointed,</hi> and <hi>read</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: <hi>Of whom as concerning the Fleſh, Chriſt is come; The God over all be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever. Amen.</hi> So <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> and <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> tranſlate here. According to this Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, our Saviour is not here called <hi>God over all;</hi> but the Apoſtle gives Thanks to God over all, for his unſpeakable Gift, our Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Our Author ſaith, that if there be any Tranſlations of this Text, which favour the Socinians, they are <hi>not much to be regarded:</hi> But this is an Anſwer, fitter for an <hi>Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to make, than for a Writer in theſe Queſtions. Seeing He undertakes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Socinians, he ought to have ſhown, that the Tranſlation which confirms their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is ſome-way faulty: He ſhould have anſwered the <hi>Critical</hi> Reaſon, which <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> give of their Tranſlation. They obſerve, that if the words <hi>[God over all]</hi> had been intended of our Lord Chriſt; the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and I doubt not that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was aware that thoſe Critics were in the right; and therefore he willingly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd both the Tranſlation, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it.</p>
               <p>If you, Sir, ſay to me, this being a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Diſpute, how ſhould an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned</hi> Man be able to judg, which of the two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was intended by the Apoſtle? What Ground can ſuch a one have to ſay, the Trinitarian Tranſlation is not Good? Yes, he is as much qualified to judg, as the moſt Learned. For ſeeing the words may be (confeſſedly by both Parcies) rendred two ways, he may be ſure, <hi>that</hi> is the true Reading and Rendring, which agrees with <hi>Evident</hi> Reaſon, and with the reſt of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: both which allow of but one Perſon, who is <hi>God over all;</hi> and if there were more ſuch Perſons, there muſt of neceſſity be more Gods. This Reaſoning directs him, which Side he is to take; not only in this Queſtion, but in all other Queſtions: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Queſtion is, if a Text or Texts be alledged, that may be tranſlated ſeveral ways; <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>true</hi> Tranſlation, which is firmed by <hi>evident</hi> Reaſon, and other <hi>clear</hi> Texts; and that is a <hi>falſe</hi> Tranſlation, which would introduce an Opinion contrary to Reaſon, or to other <hi>indiſputable</hi> Texts. Therefore the Faith of the Unlearned, may be as certain and well-grounded, as the Faith of the greateſt Critic: for either other clear and indiſputable Texts, or a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Reaſon, preſents it ſelf, and diſſolves the Difficulties.</p>
               <p>And if this were not ſo, it would not be the Duty of the Unlearned; nay, 'twould be contrary to their Duty, to be of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion or <hi>Party</hi> at all; ſuch muſt neither be Proteſtants nor Papiſts, Socinians nor Trinitarians, Remonſtrants nor Calviniſts, nor of any other Sect, becauſe of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they cannot make a <hi>critical</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of different <hi>Tranſlations.</hi> But no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will dare to ſay this: therefore ſay I, the Unlearned may, and have a right to be of a particular Side and Perſwaſion; on this Account, that by help of clear Texts, or of evident Reaſon, they may in all Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eaſily diſcern, which ſide they ought to take. I will add, that oft-times the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi> unlearned Perſon,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110211:23"/>ſees farther and clearer, than the <hi>Intereſſed, Prejudiced</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njudicious</hi> Critic, or other Learned Perſon. But of this I have ſaid enough, in that General <hi>Preface</hi> to ſome of our Pamphlets; which has this Title, <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to a Serious and Impartial Enquiry:</hi> where I ſhow, that this is the very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on which the <hi>Reformation</hi> proceeded; and that in taking it away, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt fall, and we muſt all return to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>laſt</hi> Scripture-Allegation is from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5, &amp;c. <hi>Let this Mind be in you, which was in Chriſt Jeſus: who being in the Form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took on him the Form of a Servant; and was made in the Likeneſs of Man; and being found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf, and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs. Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Miſb.</hi> has ſaid but very little on this Context; Others of his Parcy have made advantage of almoſt every Clauſe thereof. The Lord Chriſt, ſay they, <hi>was in the Form of God:</hi> What can that mean, but that <hi>He was God?</hi> for the <hi>Form</hi> of a thing, is the very <hi>Nature</hi> of it. And that this is a true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, we certainly know by the next words, which ſay; <hi>He thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</hi> Had He not been God, it had been the greateſt Robbery and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege poſſible, to think himſelf equal with God. 'Tis true, He <hi>humbled himſelf,</hi> and <hi>took on him the Form of a Servant,</hi> and was <hi>made in the likeneſs of Men,</hi> and was <hi>found in faſhion as a Man,</hi> and <hi>became obedient to the Death of the Croſs.</hi> But even theſe very Expreſſions are ſuch, as plainly intimate, that all this was nothing elſe but <hi>his Condeſcenſion;</hi> He ſloop'd to theſe things, only becauſe for great and weighty Reaſons He was pleaſed ſo to do. Of thoſe Reaſons (or Ends) the Apoſtle here mentions one, <hi>to ſet us an Example:</hi> Let that Mind (ſaith he) be in you, which was in Chriſt Jeſus; who being ſo Great a Perſon, yet humbled himſelf to take <hi>the Form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will here, Sir, tell you a Story. A certain Country-man that hapned to live in a Pariſh, where the Miniſter uſed to inſiſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often on theſe Queſtions, about the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our Saviour, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned down in his Bible <hi>the Proofs</hi> alledged by his Miniſter; and being a Man, though of no Learning, yet of a Good Capacity, he found at length how to ſatisfy himſelf of the Inſufficiency of all the Miniſter's Proofs, on be half of the Divinity of our Saviour: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was puzled with this Context out of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that Chriſt was <hi>in the Form of God,</hi> and <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> &amp;c. After much thinking, he imagined that he could give a reaſonable Account even of this Context, all but that one Expreſſion, <hi>He thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Here he ſtuck; for if Chriſt be equal with God, ſure he is (as the Church ſays) a Perſon of God, or of the Deity, and the Trinitarian Doctrine muſt be true. At length, it came into his mind, that there might be ſome Error in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation; and therefore he ask'd his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Whether the words were altogether ſo in the <hi>true Bible,</hi> (ſo he called the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Greek) as they are in the Engliſh. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: I ſuſpect, ſays he, that the word <hi>It</hi> (in this Clauſe, he thought <hi>it</hi> not robbery to be equal with God) is not in what you uſe to call the Original, and out of which you often correct our way of reading in the Engliſh Bibles; I judg that the Apoſtle ſaid only, <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>thought not robbery to be equal with God.</hi> The Miniſter was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs, that <hi>It</hi> was not in the Greek; and that it ſhould have been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the <hi>words of Supplement</hi> uſually are, in a different Character from the reſt of the Verſe. But then, Sir, ſays the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man; If the Apoſtle ſays, that <hi>Chriſt thought not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> it ſhould feem, it would indeed have been robbery, if he had thought himſelf equal with God: So that the Apoſtle's meaning
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110211:23"/>will be this; <q>Jeſus Chriſt conceived not this thing (this Robbery and Sacrilege, in his mind, to be equal with God, or that he was equal with God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is my Tale; I aſſure you, Sir, I do not make it, I had it from a Friend of Yours, whoſe Veracity you will not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: So true is it, that after all the wretched Diſguiſings of Holy Scripture, by Tranſlations <hi>groſly</hi> falſe, an induſtrious and ſagacious Enquirer, though Unlearned, may by himſelf enquire out the great Truth of Chriſtianity, <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God.</hi> I confeſs, ſuch have an hard Task, becauſe our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers have never owned in their Margin, any other <hi>Reading</hi> or <hi>Rendring</hi> in the Texts controverted between them and us, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which they have <hi>contrived</hi> to ſerve their own Turns: But by the Story I have told you, it appears not to be impoſſible to find Truth, even without the help of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> ſays, at <hi>Pag.</hi> 374. that this Context of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> is ſo clear for the Divinity of our Saviour, that Trinitarians may refer themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter, to the <hi>meereſt Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Chriſtianity,</hi> that has but read this Context. For what can be more plain? <hi>He was in the Form of God,</hi> He thought it not robbery to be <hi>Equal with God;</hi> He humbled himſelf to take <hi>the Form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and <hi>the Likeneſs and Faſhion of a Man.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>a Heathen</hi> would ſay, that the Perſon of whom theſe things are ſpoken, muſt undoubtedly be more than <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This (he thinks) is a home Charge on the Socinians; but our Country-man would have made our Author to abate a great deal of his Aſſurance: He would tell him, 'tis true, Sir, the Lord Chriſt <hi>was in the Form of God;</hi> but ſo alſo are all other Men; the Holy Scriptures inform us, that <hi>Adam</hi> and all other Men, are made in the Similitude, Form or Likeneſs of God. Which is ſo far from proving, that <hi>Adam,</hi> or Chriſt, are God, or a Perſon of God, that it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively</hi> proves, that neither of them is God; becauſe what are <hi>like,</hi> are never <hi>the ſame.</hi> 'Tis true, our Bleſſed Saviour was <hi>more</hi> in the Form, Faſhion, or Likeneſs of God, than any other Man: for beſides all that Reſemblance that we have to God, by our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> our <hi>Superiority</hi> over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the immortal <hi>undying Nature</hi> of our Souls; beſides all this, He had a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs, and a Power and Authority over Devils, Diſeaſes, the Winds and Seas; and this Form of God was given to the Lord Chriſt, that he might confirm by his Miracles that Holy Doctrine which he was to deliver from God to Men. Thus the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man</hi> would inlighten Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi>'s <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> concerning the firſt Expreſſion, <hi>He was in the Form</hi> (or Likeneſs) <hi>of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the Heathen would ſay farther; <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>thought it not robbery to be Equal to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are miſtaken, good Sir, ſays the Country-man, for our Apoſtle's words are, <hi>He thought not robbery to be Equal with God:</hi> Of which, the plain meaning is; He was not ſo Sacrilegious, as to think in his Mind, that becauſe he had ſome <hi>likeneſs</hi> to God, a far greater than any Man, or (perhaps) Angels, therefore He was Equal with God. Becauſe though He was ſo highly <hi>in the Form of God,</hi> yet he remembreth what he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>All Power is GIVEN to me,</hi> Matth. 28.18. But on the contrary, the Power of him who is <hi>true God,</hi> is not <hi>given,</hi> but is originally his own, the reſult of his own Eternal Nature.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Expreſſions, <hi>He made himſelf of no Reputation,</hi> and <hi>took on him the Form</hi> (or Likeneſs) <hi>of a Servant;</hi> they are thus to be underſtood: He deelined the Eſteem and Reputation of this World, by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miracles which he did; charging (oft-times) thoſe that were healed, not to divulge the Matter: Nay, He took on him the Form of a Servant, by ſuffering Injury and Reproach, without anſwering again; <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:110211:24"/>The Apoſtle adds, That <hi>being in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, and found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf to the Death of the Croſs.</hi> At theſe words begins a new ſenſe, neither is the word <hi>[And]</hi> prefixed to them in the Greek; their meaning is this. <q>Farther, tho Chriſt was in the Likeneſs or Form of God, by the extraordinary Power and Authority granted to him; yet becauſe he remembred, that he was made in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect in the common <hi>Likeneſs</hi> and <hi>Faſhion</hi> of all other Men, <hi>Like to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in all things, Sin excepted;</hi> therefore upon all occaſions he readily humbled himſelf; He even ſubmitted himſelf to be taken, and crucified by the Jewiſh and Roman Magiſtracy, tho He could moſt eaſily have delivered himſelf from them, becauſe He knew that by that kind of Death God ſhould be greatly glorified, and the Goſpel confirmed. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as well as on ſome others, God has highly exalted him, and given to him the Name above every Name, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Rev. 19.16.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> craftily ſuppoſes, that his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> ſhould conclude for the Divinity of our Saviour, from this only Context to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> without being before acquainted with Chriſtianity, or with Scripture: but why is He afraid to let his <hi>Heathen</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Chriſtianity and with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only with this Text? is it not becauſe the Chriſtian Profeſſion of <hi>but one God,</hi> and the expreſs words of our Saviour, <hi>My Father is greater than I;</hi> and again, <hi>I aſcend to my Father and you Father, to my God and your God:</hi> Is it not (I ſay) becauſe the knowledg of theſe other Texts, and very many the like, would make his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> to interpret this place to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as the Country-man did? But he knows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that ſome of the principal Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Criticks of his own Party, have given up to the Unitarians this Context of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians;</hi> they ingenuouſly own, that this whole Diſcourſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was by him intended of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>as Man,</hi> and not as God: He may ſee a conſiderable Collection of Authors, <hi>Fathers</hi> as well as <hi>Moderns,</hi> who make this honeſt Confeſſion: In <hi>Chr. Sandius</hi> his Interpret. Paradox, <hi>p.</hi> 359, 360. Among the reſt there cited, <hi>M. Luther (de dupl. Juſtitiâ)</hi> is very expreſs and clear.</p>
               <p>Let us, if you pleaſe, Sir, lay the whole Interpretation before given into one view, that the Reader may more eaſily make a Judgment of it. <q>Let ſuch a Mind be in you, O <hi>Philippians!</hi> as was in the glorious <hi>Head and Captain of our Salvation,</hi> the Lord Chriſt. For He being in the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Form of God, by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sanctity, and a miraculous Power over Diſeaſes and Devils, conferred on him by God; He did not (like <hi>Lucifer</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in his Mind that Impiety and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God: but (on the contrary) He made himſelf of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and took the Likeneſs of a Man of Servile Condition, by concealing the great Miracles which he did, and by bearing Injuries and Reproaches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwering again. Being made in the Likeneſs of all other Men, and found in the common Faſhion of a Man; He ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be taken by the Jews, and to undergo the Death of the Croſs, for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Men. And becauſe He was thus affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God's Honour, and the Good of Men; therefore has God highly exalted him, making him Head of the Church, both that in Heaven, and that on Earth; and giving to him that Name above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
                  </q> But hitherto of the Concerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi>'s <hi>Heathen</hi> and our <hi>Country man;</hi> I ſubmit to the Reader, which of them has beſt underſtood St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I deſire you, Sir, to conſider, what <hi>wild</hi> Work our Oppoſers make with theſe Words and this Context of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and how they make no ſcruple to render him guilty of the moſt palpable Self-Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in one and the ſame Breath. The Lord
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110211:24"/>Chriſt, ſaith this Apoſtle, <hi>was in the Form of God;</hi> that is, ſay our Oppoſers, he had the very Nature of God, or was truly and really God; and <hi>He thought it not Robbery</hi> (ſo They make the Apoſtle to ſpeak) <hi>to be equal with God.</hi> Now, if He was <hi>God,</hi> how could He <hi>be equal with God?</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ever ſaid to be equal with it ſelf: Equality and Likeneſs muſt be between <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi> and <hi>divers</hi> things.</p>
               <p>Well, He was God, and was equal with God, and yet <hi>made himſelf of no Reputation, took on him the Form of a Servant, was made in the likeneſs and faſhion of Men; nay, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf to Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> But 'tis both Morally and Phyſically, or naturally impoſſible, that God ſhould do any of theſe things, undergo any of theſe Changes. Why do they not perceive, that. He who is true God, cannot <hi>make himſelf of no Reputation;</hi> or take the Form of a Servant, the Likeneſs and Faſhion of Men; or ſubmit himſelf to Death?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle goes on, <hi>Wherefore God hath alſo highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name.</hi> O ſtrange! God exalts God, and <hi>gives</hi> to him (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that He had it not before) a Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Name. I would know, what Name could be given to him above the Name he had before?</p>
               <p>I do not pretend, Sir, that they own this Interpretation in the very terms I have here ſet it down: but this I ſay, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their Hypotheſis, that the Lord Chriſt is true God; this and no other was, I muſt not ſay the Apoſtle's <hi>Senſe,</hi> but his meaning it was. You may pleaſe, Sir, to compare it with that eaſy and natural Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of the Socinians, which was before mentioned, and then tell me, which of them would be choſen even by a (ſenſible) <hi>Heathen,</hi> to whom our Oppoſer has thought fit to make his Appeal.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> On what he objects from the Actions or Miracles of our Saviour.</head>
               <p>AFter he has done with particular Texts, our Author (from <hi>P.</hi> 381.) ſpends ſome Sheets in recounting certain <hi>Actions</hi> of our Saviour, by which it may appear that he was true God, that one true God whom the Scriptures every where propound to us, as the only legitimate Object of Faith and Worſhip. He ſaith, for inſtance, our Saviour did many wonderful Miracles, and that too <hi>in his own Name,</hi> not as the Miniſter or Inſtrument of another, but in <hi>a commanding way;</hi> as when he rebuked the Winds and Waves, and caſt out Devils. He healed Diſeaſes <hi>by a Virtue iſſuing from himſelf;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Woman who was cured by only touching his Garment, and by his own words thereupon, <hi>Virtue is gone out of me.</hi> Nor did he cure only the Diſtempers of the Body, but thoſe of the Mind and Soul; for he invited to him <hi>the weary and heavy-laden,</hi> promiſing that he would <hi>give them Reſt;</hi> which is a ſort of Language never uſed by any Prophet, or meer Man: nay, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave to divers their Sins, which ('tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) only God can do.</p>
               <p>As a farther Diſplay of his Divinity, 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>He knew what was in Man;</hi> and he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I am He which ſearcheth the Reins and Heart.</hi> There can be no greater Omniſcience than this, nor can Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience belong to any but God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:110211:25"/>After his Reſurrection, <hi>He openid the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings</hi> of his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>He <hi>breathed on them,</hi> and thereby confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Holy Spirit, which being God's <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> even in the Opinion of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, How can it be given by any but God?</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>He himſelf</hi> ſhed on them the ſame Holy Spirit in a miraculous manner, when he cauſed the Spirit to deſcend on them, in the likeneſs of cloven Tongues: but if he were not <hi>God,</hi> how ſhould he give <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> to others?</p>
               <p>They are his own words to his Diſciples, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you;</hi> but that could not be ſaid by him, if he had not the <hi>ſame</hi> Authority (or were not equal) with the Father.</p>
               <p>After his Aſcenſion his Diſciples did their Miracles <hi>in his Name,</hi> or only <hi>by Faith in him;</hi> but no meer Man can enable another to do Miracles; nor can Faith in a meer Man avail to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He ſent St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be a Miniſter to the Gentiles, to convert them to God; that ſo, ſaith he, they may have Remiſſion of Sins, and an Inheritance among thoſe <hi>who are ſanctified by Faith in me;</hi> or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in me. And in doing all this, ſaith he farther to that Apoſtle, <hi>I will deliver thee from the People, and the Gentiles, to whom I ſend thee;</hi> Acts 26.16, 17, 18. Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> ſeems to think there is a great Force in theſe Allegations, towards the evincing that the Lord Chriſt was indeed God; and with theſe Proofs he concludes his preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from Scripture. Let us examine what he hath ſaid, part by part.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, firſt, our Saviour did Miracles, <hi>in his own Name, not as the Miniſter or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another.</hi> But this is not the Language of Scripture; the expreſs words of our Saviour, and the whole current of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are againſt it. John 17.28. <hi>I am not come of my ſelf.</hi> John 5.43. <hi>I am come in my Father's Name.</hi> John 5.30. <hi>I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my ſelf.</hi> Mat. 12.28. <hi>I caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by the Spirit of God.</hi> John 14.10. <hi>The Father that dwilleth in me</hi> (to wit, by his Spirit) <hi>be doth the Works.</hi> Acts 2.22. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a Man approved of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, by Miracles, Wonders and Signs which God did by him in the midſt of you.</hi> Aſſuredly theſe Texts declare as evidently as in words can be done, that the Lord Chriſt was no more than <hi>the Inſtrument and Miniſter of God,</hi> and of his Spirit, in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles; and that it was in the <hi>Father's Name,</hi> not in his own, that he appeared and acted.</p>
               <p>But he healed Diſeaſes <hi>by a Virtue iſſuing from himſelf;</hi> for he ſaid, <hi>Virtue is gone out of me.</hi> That there was a <hi>Balſamick</hi> and Sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Virtue in the Body of our Saviour, I will not deny; but neither can it be denied, that the like Virtue was alſo given by God to the Bodies of ſome of the Apoſtles: for Handkerchiefs from their Bodies, and their Shadows healed many, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.15. &amp; 19.12.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any more Force in that, that the Lord Chriſt invites to him <hi>the Heavy-laden,</hi> promiſing to give them <hi>Reſt</hi> to their Souls. For he gave <hi>Reſt</hi> to Souls ſenſible of the Guilt and Burden of Sin, <hi>by his Doctrine;</hi> which every Goſpel-Preacher may do, nay, ought to do. A Goſpel-Preacher is to declare to the Senſible and Penitent, the Forgiveneſs and Abſolution of God, and thereby gives them <hi>Reſt</hi> and Peace.</p>
               <p>But 'tis marvellous that this Author ſhould urge it as a Proof of our Saviour's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that He declared to ſome Perſons, whoſe Faith appeared in viſible Acts of Piety and Truſt in God, that their Sins were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; for ſure he knows what is ſaid to the Apoſtles at <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſe Sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſe Sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Let him ſhow, if he can, that our Saviour ever claimed any higher Authority or Power than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are here veſted with, by Command from God. But I think it were not hard to prove, that in all theſe Texts, the word <hi>Sins</hi> is put for the Effect of Sins, even <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> ſo as to make this ſenſe; that our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110211:25"/>Saviour and his Apoſtles had Authority and Power, either to looſe Men from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and Ails, or to leave them in them, as they ſhould ſee reaſon and cauſe, either for the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Benefit of the Perſon, or for Confirmation of the Goſpel, by ſuch Signs and Wonders.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Chriſt <hi>knew what was in Man,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John.</hi> But he doth not ſay, that he knew it <hi>of himſelf,</hi> by a Natural Omniſcience, without Revelation from God.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> knew what was in the Mind of the Queen of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Kings 14.6. <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew what his Servant <hi>Gehazi</hi> had done, and what he purpoſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.22. The ſame Prophet knew the Counſels that the King of <hi>Syria</hi> took againſt the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.9, 12. He told <hi>Hazael,</hi> not only what <hi>was in his Heart,</hi> but what ſhould be there in time to come, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.12. The Holy Scriptures do not expreſly ſay, that the Knowledg which theſe Prophets had of <hi>what was in Man;</hi> or, what is the ſame thing, the ſecret Thoughts of their Hearts, was only <hi>derivative,</hi> or by God's Revelation: They ſuppoſed there was no need to inſtruct or warn the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a matter that was ſelf-evident. But, as if foreſeeing the monſtrous Doctrine that ſome would advance concerning the great Miniſter and Prophet of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the Lord Chriſt; and deſigning to arm the Faithful againſt it; they have been careful to tell us <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>explicitly,</hi> that the Prophetick Knowledg that was in him, was derivative, or <hi>by Revelation from God,</hi> not from himſelf, or by a Natural Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his own. Rev. 1.1. <hi>The Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave to him, to ſhew unto his Servants things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs. And He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſent and ſignified it by his Angel</hi> (or, by his Meſſenger) <hi>to his Servant</hi> John. How can a conſidering Man doubt, that if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our knew the things which muſt very ſhortly come to paſs, only by God's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them to him; that his Knowledg too of what was in the Hearts and Minds of Men, muſt be alſo by God's Revelation, or the Inhabitation of the Spirit of God in him?</p>
               <p>But our Author urgeth, that the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am He which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts:</hi> Rev. 2.23.</p>
               <p>He ought to know, that <hi>to ſearch the Heart and Reins,</hi> is an Hebrew and Scripture Phraſe and form of ſpeaking, and ſignifies no more but this, <hi>to know the moſt ſecret Thoughts and Purpoſes of the Mind and Heart.</hi> This is a Property that can belong only to God, to know (or, as the Hebrew ſpeaks, to <hi>ſearch</hi>) the Hearts and Thoughts, if you mean there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>originally,</hi> or <hi>of himſelf,</hi> or <hi>by his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and proper Omniſcience:</hi> but the Prophets, and more eſpecially the Lord Chriſt, know the Hearts and Reins <hi>by God's Revelation to them,</hi> and ſearch the Thoughts <hi>by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit of God in them.</hi> When therefore our Saviour ſaith here, <hi>I ſearch the Hearts,</hi> he meant this, I know the Thoughts of the Heart, <hi>by God's Revelation to me,</hi> or <hi>by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting Spirit in me.</hi> In a word, God only knoweth the Thoughts of the Heart, and <hi>what is in Man,</hi> originally, of himſelf, or by his own proper and natural Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But Prophets ſearch or know the Hearts, and what is in Man, <hi>ſecondarily, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivatively, by God's Revelation to them,</hi> by his inhabiting Spirit in them. We are aſſured that this laſt only was our Saviour's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in theſe words, <hi>I ſearch the Hearts;</hi> by the firſt words of this Book of Revelation, before quoted, even theſe, <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave to him.</hi> There could be no need that God ſhould make a Revelation to him, if he himſelf knew the Reins and Hearts by a natural Omniſcience of his own.</p>
               <p>We are not therefore to ſtick at the meet words, <hi>I ſearch the Heart,</hi> but to conſider the Import or Senſe of that Phraſe in the Scripture-Language; which ſignifying only this, to know the Thoughts of the Heart or Mind; they do not prove the Perſon of whom they are ſpoken, to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110211:26"/>Omniſcient, or God, unleſs it had been ſaid He ſearcheth (or He knoweth) the Hearts <hi>by his own Omniſcience,</hi> and not (as 'tis ſaid of our Saviour) <hi>by Revelation from God,</hi> or God's inhabiting Spirit.</p>
               <p>When the Lord Chriſt <hi>opened the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings</hi> of the two Diſciples, <hi>that they might underſtand the Scriptures;</hi> this was not an Act of his Power, but the Effect of the Diſcourſe he made to them: He opened their Underſtandings, to underſtand the <hi>Prophetic</hi> Scriptures, <hi>by explaining thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He conferred a Meaſure of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the External Sign of <hi>breathing on the Diſciples.</hi> We can no more infer from hence that he was God, than that the Apoſtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were ſo many Gods, becauſe they gave the Spirit by the External Sign of <hi>laying on their Hands,</hi> Acts 19.6. The <hi>latter</hi> was as great a Miracle as the <hi>former,</hi> and both of them the effect of God's Power, not of Man's.</p>
               <p>But 'tis falſe, what our Author here adds; that our Lord Chriſt did <hi>Himſelf ſhed on them the Holy Spirit,</hi> when he cauſed the Spirit to deſcend on them in the form of Cloven Tongues. The Apoſtle indeed ſaith, <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>hath ſhed forth this</hi> (this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Participation of the Spirit) <hi>which ye now ſee and hear:</hi> But he ſaith not, as our Author reports his words, He <hi>himſelf</hi> hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear; for it was not He <hi>himſelf,</hi> but He <hi>by the Gift of God,</hi> that ſhed forth the Spirit on them. Let us hear the whole Verſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Therefore He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>being by the right Hand of God exalted; and having received</hi> (or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) <hi>of the Father, his Promiſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; He hath ſhed forth this, which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> Here indeed the Spirit is ſaid to be ſhed forth by the Lord Chriſt on the Apoſtles, but not by Him <hi>himſelf;</hi> but He ſhed it forth, <hi>having</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of the Father.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, having received this Power from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which afterwards the Apoſtles alſo received of the Father, even the Power of conferring the Spirit: He now ſhed it forth on them; not He <hi>himſelf,</hi> by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Power, but by the Warrant, Order, Grant or Commiſſion of the Father. If our Saviour had conferred the Spirit on his Diſciples, by his own Power or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it would not have been ſaid; that <hi>having received of the Father his Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he ſhed it abroad on his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let our Oppoſers ſhow, that the Lord Chriſt was more than the Inſtrument, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Mediator, by Whom, and at whoſe Inſtance, God ſhed forth the Spirit: neither this, nor any other Context aſcribes more to him; and as much as is elſewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6.</p>
               <p>They are words which our Saviour ſpeaks to his Diſciples; <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you.</hi> But it follows not from hence, that the Authority and Power of Chriſt, was equal to the Power and Authority of the Father: nay, the contrary rather follows; for the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is but the Miniſter and Servant of the Sender.</p>
               <p>After Jeſus was aſcended into Heaven, his Diſciples did their Miracles <hi>in his Name;</hi> and <hi>by Faith in him.</hi> Acts 3.6. <hi>In the Name of Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>riſe up and walk.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>His Name, through Faith in his Name, hath made this Man ſtrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We confeſs hereupon, that Miracles were done <hi>by the Name,</hi> or <hi>in the Name</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, and <hi>through Faith in his Name:</hi> But how does this prove that he was God? Such Miracles prove indeed, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whoſe Name they are done, is a moſt Powerful and Effectual <hi>Mediator</hi> with God, but not that He himſelf is God; they prove, that he is acceptable to God; and that what he <hi>deſireth,</hi> that alſo God <hi>willeth;</hi> but not that he is the true &amp; proper Author of thoſe Miracles. 'Tis a <hi>particular</hi> Honour that God is pleaſed to do to the Lord Chriſt, that <hi>in his Name</hi> Wonders ſhould be done; and that <hi>ſome</hi> who believed in his Name,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110211:26"/>ſhould on that account be enabled to do Miracles: But when our Oppoſers infer from hence, therefore Chriſt is God, this is no <hi>Neceſſary</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> Conſequence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing hinders but that God may confer the ſame Honour on any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Thing. Nor, ſecondly, is it a true Conſequence; becauſe we are aſſured, by innumerable <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that the Lord Chriſt is not God. As, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally; Our Lord promis'd, that he would <hi>deliver his Apoſtle from the People, and from the Gentiles;</hi> and declares, that <hi>we are ſanctified by Faith in his Name,</hi> or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18, &amp;c. He delivered indeed that Apoſtle, from very many Machinations of the Jews, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies of the Gentiles; but all this as <hi>Mediator,</hi> not as <hi>God:</hi> by his Interceſſion, <hi>which</hi> (as this Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>he ever liveth to make,</hi> on behalf of all the Faithful; and more eſpecially of ſuch as are <hi>extraordinarily</hi> commiſſioned to the Work of propagating the Goſpel in Heathen Nations, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was.</p>
               <p>As to our being <hi>ſanctified</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> made Holy) <hi>by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> or by believing in him, it was never queſtioned, I think, by any; but the meaning of the Expreſſion is only this, that ſuch as ſincerely believe the Lord Chriſt, and the Goſpel or Doctrine by him delivered, do <hi>ſanctify themſelves;</hi> they refrain from every Evil Work and Word; their Faith does diſpoſe and incline them, of its own Nature and Tendency, to Sanctification and Holineſs; this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaning of our being <hi>ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> On what is alledged from the Fathers.</head>
               <p>OUR Author paſſes from <hi>ſacred</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Profane,</hi> for proving the Doctrines of the Trinity, and the Divinity and Incarnation of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>He quotes the Account which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> concerning the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; that they were wont to meet <hi>before Day, Et Carmen Chriſto canere ut Deo, To ſing Pſalms to Chriſt as if he were a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cites alſo a Dialogue, ſuppoſed to be <hi>Lucian</hi>'s, in which that Author jeers the God who is <hi>Three and One.</hi> Theſe two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were very Ancient, within about 100 Years after Chriſt; and their words (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted) ſhow, How <hi>early</hi> the belief of the Trinity, and of the Divinity of our Saviour was found among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Writers, he brings ſome Fragments out of <hi>Juſtin, Ignatius, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Tertullian, Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Cyprian, Lactantius, Gregory Thaumatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Faelix;</hi> alſo out of the Councils of <hi>Nice, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith; the Socinians are apt to appeal in theſe Queſtions, to the <hi>Ante-Nicen</hi> Fathers before-named; and that ſeveral great Men, ſuch as <hi>Eraſmus, Grotius, Petavius,</hi> and others, yield this Point to Us.</p>
               <p>I will make no Advantage of our Author's Ignorance in this Matter; I will freely own to you, Sir, that the Socinians never Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal (in theſe Queſtions) to the Fathers, whether <hi>Ante-Nicen,</hi> or others, <hi>who are now extant.</hi> We grant, they were in Sentiments very different from ours, all the <hi>Ante-Nicen</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:110211:27"/>Fathers, I mean, <hi>whoſe works have been ſuffer'd to come down to our Times,</hi> were in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (concerning God and the Lord Chriſt) afterwards called <hi>Arrianiſm;</hi> except (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who ſeems to have held the ſame with <hi>Savellius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do <hi>Eraſmus, Petavius, Grotius,</hi> and other Criticks grant to us, as he ſuppoſes, that the <hi>Ante-Nicen</hi> Fathers were of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; they have granted thoſe Fathers, not to us, but to the <hi>Arrians.</hi> They grant, thoſe Fathers did not hold the Doctrine of the Trinity, or of the Divinity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>in ſuch manner as 'tis now held by the Church;</hi> for the Church holds a Trinity of Three <hi>Coequal</hi> and <hi>Coeternal</hi> Perſons, all of them jointly and equally <hi>Creators,</hi> none of them <hi>Creatures:</hi> but thoſe Fathers held a Trinity, in which only the Firſt Perſon is <hi>truly</hi> God, or <hi>the moſt high God;</hi> the Second and Third are <hi>Creatures,</hi> though alſo they were <hi>the Creators</hi> (according to theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets) <hi>of the other Creatures.</hi> They ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſometimes, that the Son is <hi>Coeternal,</hi> and a Creator: but by Coeternal they mean only, that he was not made <hi>in Time,</hi> but in that <hi>Eternity</hi> which did precede <hi>Time,</hi> and the Creation of the World. They call that Duration, <hi>Time,</hi> which began with the World, and which is both Made and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Motion of the Sun, and other Heavenly Bodies; and that Duration is by them called <hi>Eternity,</hi> which preceded thoſe Bodies, and the Motions which make <hi>Time.</hi> Therefore when they call the Son, <hi>Coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> which (I think) is not found in all their Writings above once or twice; they do not mean, that He was <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> Coexiſtent with the Father from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: But 'tis their Intention to ſay, He was <hi>made</hi> by the Father in that Duration which Philoſophy calls <hi>Eternity,</hi> ſome ſpace before the World was made, that he might be the Father's <hi>Inſtrument</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi> in creating all things. Hereby they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that the Son was in ſome ſenſe <hi>a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and <hi>God;</hi> but it was only as He was the Father's <hi>Miniſter, Inſtrument</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi> (thoſe are the Terms they uſe) in making all things: He was <hi>a Creator</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> with reſpect to all other Creatures, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect (ſay they) to the true and moſt high God, He is only a Servant and a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>In a word, the <hi>Ante-Nicen</hi> Fathers (<hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe of the firſt 325 Years) <hi>whoſe Works have been ſuffered to be extant,</hi> neither held as the Unitarians do, that the Lord Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have a Being, when He was born of the Virgin; nor as the Church now does, that He was <hi>true</hi> God, and always <hi>actually Coexiſtent with God:</hi> but they held with the Arrians, that He was <hi>Created, Begotten,</hi> or <hi>Made,</hi> (for theſe are, with them, equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Terms) in that Tract or Duration which is called, not Time, but <hi>Eternity;</hi> and that He was the Father's <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> in making <hi>firſt</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>then</hi> the reſt of the Creation.</p>
               <p>This is that which is granted by <hi>Petavius, Huetius, Mornay, Eraſmus, Grotius,</hi> and other Criticks on the Fathers; not (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſuppoſes) that thoſe Fathers held the Doctrine concerning God, and our Lord Chriſt, that is now called <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though this be ſo, yet we doubt not that we are able to prove, that the general Body of Chriſtians, and an incomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It has not availed our Oppoſers, that they have ſuppreſs'd the works of thoſe moſt Ancient Fathers, who are known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to have been Unitarians, ſuch as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila, Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Theadotion,</hi> who ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently tranſlated the Hebrew Bible into Greek; and <hi>Lucianus,</hi> who reſtored the Greek Copiet to their firſt Integrity: <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi> Men (noted by their Adverſaries to have been) incomparably Learned, and ancienter than any of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> Fathers, as we now call them. <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>Beſides this, the only Creed of all the Churches till the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and which is called <hi>the Apoſties Creed</hi> (becauſe it contains the true <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Tradition) is confeſt on all hands to be wholly <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi> That Creed acknowledges but one God, <hi>the Father Almighty;</hi> and but one <hi>only Son</hi> of God; even him (ſaith this Creed) who was conceived, generated or begotten by the Holy Ghoſt on the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> not (as our Oppoſers feign) an Eternal Son, begotten of the Eſſence of God his Father. But I will not, Sir, now dilate on theſe things, it ſhall be done in a Treatiſe by it ſelf, if it pleaſe God to give me <hi>Leiſure</hi> and <hi>Opportunity:</hi> in the mean time I appeal to thoſe Learned Criticks, <hi>Petavius</hi> and others before mentioned, that the ordinary pretence of ſuch Scriblers and Scioliſts as our Author, is utterly falſe and ungrounded, even this, that the Ante-nicen Fathers held the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>as the Church now does.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Scoffs of <hi>Lucian</hi> on the God who is <hi>Three and One, One and Three,</hi> not having the Book by me, I cannot tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meant to jeer the Trinity of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſophers, or of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; I conjecture he means the former.</p>
               <p>Neither was he ſo ancient as ſome give out; the beſt Criticks make him to have flouriſh'd about the Year of our Lord 176, when the <hi>new</hi> Doctrines were grown very riſe and common.</p>
               <p>The Account that <hi>Pliny</hi> gives of the Chriſtians to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> is <hi>ancient;</hi> but (in the particular objected to us) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>uncertain.</hi> The Copies of <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s Time, expreſt the matter thus, <hi>Ad canendum Chriſto &amp; Deo, They ſang Pſalms of Praiſe to Chriſt and to God;</hi> not <hi>(ut Deo)</hi> to Chriſt <hi>as God.</hi> The very words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> are theſe; <q>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Trajan,</hi> objects nothing elſe to them, but that they were obſtinate in refuſing to ſactifice: and that they held <hi>(caetus ante lucanos, ad canendam Chriſto</hi> &amp; <hi>Dio</hi>) Meetings before day, to ſing to Chriſt <hi>and</hi> to God.</q> 
                  <hi>Tertul. Apol. adv. Gentes,</hi> c. 3.

               <p>But admitting now, that we were to read <hi>ut Deo,</hi> as to a God: <hi>Pliny</hi> in theſe words might ſpeak only his own Opinion, not the Opinion of the Chriſtians: He might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that becauſe the Chriſtians ſang cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Compoſitions</hi> in Praiſe of the Lord Chriſt in their Meetings, therefore they held him to be a God.

               <p>FRom the Fathers, our Author returns again to the Scriptures, and advances an Argument to prove our Saviour's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from thoſe Texts which ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the Lord Chriſt is to be <hi>prayed unto;</hi> and alſo from others, in which 'tis ſaid, that even while he was upon Earth, he was <hi>worſhipped</hi> by ſome, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the <hi>worſhip</hi> paid to him.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, no Perſon can be the proper Object of Divine Worſhip, ſuch as <hi>Prayer</hi> is, but He who is Omniſcient, Omnipotent, and Omnipreſent; and that if the Socinians aſcribe theſe Properties to our Saviour, they make him to be <hi>true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>worſhipped,</hi> and that he <hi>ought</hi> to be worſhipped, he proves from theſe Texts; Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given to him a Name above every Name: That at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things on Earth, and things under the Earth; And that every Tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord.</hi> Mat. 28.16, 17. <hi>The eleven Diſciples went away into</hi> Galilee, <hi>into a Mountain where Jeſus had appointed them. And when they ſaw him, they worſhipped him.</hi> With others the like.</p>
               <p>Then for <hi>praying</hi> to him, there are theſe Texts: Mat. 8.25. <hi>Lord, ſave us, or we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> Luke 17.5. <hi>Lord, increaſe our Faith.</hi> Acts 7.59. <hi>Lord Jeſus, receive my Spirit.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.8, 9. <hi>I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me: but he ſaid to me, My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> — <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.11, 12. <hi>God himſelf and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, direct our way to you.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. <hi>To all that (in every place) call upon the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> To which laſt there are ſeveral other Texts which are Parallels.</p>

                  <head>Of the Invocation of Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>That we are to <hi>pray</hi> not only to God, but alſo to the Lord Chriſt, is held by very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Unitarians themſelves; from the time that <hi>G. Blandrata</hi> and <hi>F. Socinus</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this Point againſt their Oppoſers in the Conferences and Synods of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Party urged, as Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi> here does, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To all who in every place call on the Name of the Lord Chriſt.</hi> It was anſwered, that the words of this, and other the like Texts, ſhould have been rendred, To all who in every place <hi>are called by the Name of the Lord Chriſt; i. e.</hi> who from <hi>Chriſt</hi> are called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> It was ſaid further, that admitting the Vulgar Tranſlation, yet to <hi>call on the Name of Chriſt,</hi> imports no more but this, even <hi>to call on his Name in Prayer;</hi> that is, to go to God in the Name of Chriſt, calling on his Name, as that only Name by which we can be heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Socinus</hi> alledged the words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>God himſelf even our Father, and the Lord Chriſt, direct our way to you.</hi> It was anſwered, that this, and what follows, is not a formal <hi>Prayer;</hi> but the Apoſtle <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>wiſhes</hi> that his Journey to <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> may be directed and proſpered <hi>by God,</hi> as the Fountain of all good and favourable Providences, and <hi>by the Lord Chriſt</hi> as the Mediator who cantinually interceeds for all neceſſary Benefits for the Faithful, both Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Benefits and Spiritual. 'Tis in the ſame manner that we are to interpret the next words, <hi>The Lord make you to abound and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110211:28"/>increaſe in Love:</hi> for the Efficiency of the Lord Chriſt (if he be the Perſon here meant) in conferring Grace of any kind, is only <hi>by his Mediation,</hi> the general Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he makes for all the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Socinus</hi> went on; The Apoſtle ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Thorn (or Temptation) in his Fleſh, that he <hi>beſought the Lord thrice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: who anſwered, <hi>My Grace is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thee</hi> from whence the Apoſtle concludes, that he <hi>will glory in his Infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt may reſt on him.</hi> But it was ſaid, <hi>the Lord</hi> to whom the Apoſtle prayed, is the Lord <hi>God,</hi> not the Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and by thoſe words, <hi>I will glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt may reſt on me;</hi> He means, he will even boaſt and rejoice in his Infirmities, ſeeing they are the occaſion of manifeſting the Power of Chriſt; namely, the Virtue and Power of <hi>Chriſt's Mediation</hi> with God, the Effects of which do reſt on him, and on all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Socinus</hi> alledged St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s dying words, <hi>Lord Jeſus, receive my Spirit.</hi> They replied, every one may ſee in the Original, that it ſhould have been tranſlated, <hi>O Lord of Jeſus,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> O God) <hi>receive my Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was good reaſon why St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould uſe this Form, <hi>O Lord of Jeſus,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than barely <hi>O my God,</hi> or any ſuch like: for being tried and condemned for his Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, it was proper to make mention of him, and to bear Teſtimony to him with his very laſt and dying words. It were enough for another to ſay, O Lord God, receive my Spirit: But a Martyr for Chriſt, and the firſt Martyr very properly ſaid, O thou Lord of Jeſus, for whoſe Name and Profeſſion I ſuffer, receive my Spirit.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether <hi>Socinus</hi> urged the words of the Apoſtles to our Saviour, <hi>Lord, increaſe our Faith;</hi> and again, <hi>Lord, ſave us, or we periſh:</hi> I judg he was more judicious than to trifle after ſuch a manner. For when they ſay, <hi>Increaſe our Faith,</hi> and <hi>ſave us</hi> from ſinking in this Storm: they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly meant, that he ſhould increaſe their Faith, <hi>by his Prayers to God for them;</hi> and that he ſhould <hi>ſave them</hi> from ſinking, by that miraculous Power which Prophets have over the Works of Nature: as when <hi>Eliſha</hi> made Iron to ſwim; when he blinded the Hoſt of the Syrians; when <hi>Moſes</hi> divided the Red Sea, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> broke down the Walls of <hi>Jericho.</hi> That this is a true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, we learn from the words of the Apoſtles, when the Storm ceaſed, and the Danger was over; <hi>What manner of MAN,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is this, that even the Winds and Sea obey him?</hi> They cried not our, as Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> and his Fellow <hi>Lycaonians</hi> do, <hi>The Gods are come down to us in the likneſs of Men:</hi> but as ſober Men bred up in the knowledg of the Scriptures, and to the acknowledgment of one only God; <hi>What manner of MAN is this?</hi> How great a Prophet, whom both the Sea and Winds obey?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Unitarians, who contended that we ought to pray only to God, thought that they very much confirmed the before-mentioned Anſwers, by urging firſt, that our Saviour being conſulted about the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> of Prayers, anſwered; When ye pray, ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, God is the only Object of Prayer, you can addreſs to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to Him: but go to him as to your <hi>Father,</hi> with the ingenuous Aſſurance of <hi>Children,</hi> not the Dread and Awe of meer Creatures and <hi>Vaſſals.</hi> Secondly, Speaking alſo of the time of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion into Heaven, he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 16.23. <hi>In that day ye ſhall ask me nothing:</hi> —<hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name</hi> (calling on my Name) <hi>be will give it you.</hi> Elſewhere he ſaith, <hi>I will give it you;</hi> meaning, by his Interceſſion with God. 'Tis plainly as much as to ſay; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have asked many things of me, becauſe I am preſent with you to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for you; but the time is coming, when ye can ask me nothing, becauſe I ſhall be taken from you; but be comforted, and ask immediately of the Father, calling on my Name, he will give you whatſoever
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110211:29"/>you ſhall ask, if it be good for you. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; To make Chriſt himſelf the Object to which we pray, is to deſtroy his <hi>Mediatory Office:</hi> For if he hears our Prayers, and both <hi>can</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> (by a Power conſtantly veſted in him, as <hi>Socinus</hi> ſuppoſes) relieve our Wants; to what purpoſe is he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be our Advocate and Interceſſor with God?</p>
                  <p>How unlike, and utterly inconſiſtent, are theſe two Sayings; this of <hi>Socinus,</hi> We may and ought to pray to the Lord Chriſt as He who can himſelf help us; and this (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>it able to ſave to the uttermoſt All that come unto God by him,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> that pray to God, calling on his Name, or for his ſake) <hi>ſeeing He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> What can be more evident, than that here Chriſt's ſaving us from the Evils, which we either fear or labour under, is aſcribed not to his own Inherent Power, but to the Power of his Interceſſion or Mediation with God? Which Mediation is not to be underſtood of a <hi>Verbal</hi> or <hi>Perſonal</hi> Mediation, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a particular knowledg of our Wants or Prayers; but of a general Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation for All, <hi>by his Merits;</hi> that is, by the perfect Obedience, and moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Services that he has performed to God.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, <hi>Socinus,</hi> and the Socinians properly ſo called, do not own <hi>the Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Office of Chriſt:</hi> But they make him to be a Mediator, not that He intercedes for us, but becauſe He is <hi>Medius inter Deum &amp; Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, between God and Men;</hi> being veſted with a Power from God, to beſtow on the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, all neceſſary and convenient Things; in a word, He is not an <hi>Interceſſor</hi> for Us, but a <hi>King</hi> to protect and help us.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Volkelius</hi> (as he has been publiſhed, perhaps corrected, by <hi>Crellius</hi>) ſaith, <hi>Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <q>Although Chriſt did now pray for us, <hi>which yet we do not grant,</hi> it will not follow that He himſelf may not be prayed unto; for nothing hinders, but that he who prays to another, may alſo be prayed to. <hi>De verâ Relig.

                  </p>
                  <p>For my own part, I do not affirm any thing upon this Queſtion; but I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned theſe Arguments and Replies, that it may appear, that if our preſent Oppoſer (Mr. <hi>Milb.</hi>) does indeed ſay true, <hi>that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt needs be God, who may be prayed unto;</hi> yet it will not follow, <hi>therefore the Lord Chriſt is God;</hi> becauſe it cannot be <hi>demonſtratively</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that there is any real Scripture-ground for praying unto him.</p>
                  <p>But he will ſtill urge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at leaſt thoſe Unitarians who contend for the Invocation of the Lord Chriſt, are within danger and reach of his Objection; even this, that they muſt aſcribe to Chriſt an Omniſcience, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, and Omnipreſence; which are the very Attributes, the <hi>eſſential</hi> Attributes of the One true God.</p>
                  <p>I do not think this is a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; they do not make <hi>another God</hi> by their praying to the Lord Chriſt: it doth not follow, that He is Omnipreſent, Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Omnipotent, becauſe 'tis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and held, that He may be prayed unto, and alſo can ſupply all our Wants.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For Omniſcience. 'Tis the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion of all Sects and Parties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that the glorified Saints have more than <hi>a Prophetick Knowledg,</hi> by what which the Schools have called <hi>the Beatifick Viſion;</hi> or, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>by ſeeing God as he is.</hi> The Benefit of <hi>the Beatifick Viſion,</hi> ſhall be to Perſons, in proportion to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Duty and Love, which they have ſhowed to the Service of God: Therefore our Lord Chriſt in his preſent Glorified State, may have ſuch a perfect <hi>ſight</hi> of God, as to ſee in him, the Deſires and Prayers, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, Defects and Perfections of ſuch as call upon God in his Name. The Fathers and Schools do ſuppoſe, that the Saints in Heaven know very many things, both paſt and to come, by the Beatifick <hi>Viſion;</hi> and that the Converſation in Heaven is not by <hi>Speech</hi> or Words, but by <hi>Intuition</hi> or Viſion, or ſome the like way: 'Tis not therefore ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110211:29"/>or bordering on <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or on <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheiſm;</hi> if we ſuppoſe, that by the ſame Beatifick Viſion, our Prayers are known to the Lord Chriſt, eſpecially conſidering, that He is the <hi>Appointed</hi> Mediator for us.</p>
                  <p>Next for Omnipotence and Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; the Lord Chriſt may be able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours us in Wants, both Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, without our ſuppoſing either that He is Omnipreſent or Omnipotent: For the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of God can confer even <hi>on things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,</hi> a miraculous Power; nay ſuch a Power as can effect Miracles at the greateſt diſtance. Thus the Bones of the Prophet had Power to reſtore a dead Man to Life: The Brazen Serpent healed ſuch as did but look toward it from <hi>a diſtant</hi> Place. But if ſuch Virtue as this could be given to <hi>inanimate</hi> Things; the Divine Wiſdom may have <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and the Divine Omnipotence has an <hi>Ability</hi> to enable the Lord Chriſt to do Miracles, <hi>as far as from Heaven to Earth;</hi> and ſuch Miracles too, as reach the <hi>Minds</hi> as well as the <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men.</p>
                  <p>We know not the Philoſophy, or the Manner of the thing: but as 'tis (undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) not impoſſible; ſo 'tis an Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis more <hi>rational,</hi> and infinitely more <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>pious,</hi> than to multiply <hi>Gods;</hi> or what is the ſame thing, (only in other words) <hi>Divine Perſons,</hi> as our Trinitarian Oppoſers do.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add farther, upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Invocation of Chriſt; that whereas 'tis a Queſtion, that has very much divided the Unitarians, <hi>Whether the Lord Chriſt may be prayed unto?</hi> There is no cauſe why the ſhould not bear with one another, notwithſtanding their diſſent about this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For we have ſeen, that He may be the Object of Prayer, without making him <hi>God,</hi> or a Perſon of God; and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to him the Properties of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, Omnipreſence, Omniſcience and Omnipotence. Nor (on the other hand) do ſuch as refuſe to pray to any but God, diſhonour the Lord Chriſt; even tho it be ſuppoſed that He may be prayed to; becauſe in refuſing to pray to him, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe what they ſuppoſe that He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath forbidden; which maketh their Error, if it be an Error, to be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>meer Error,</hi> not Malice, not Neglect or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which are <hi>the only things that are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by a juſt Judg,</hi> whether ſuch Judg be God or a Man. Which one thing, were it but <hi>conſidered</hi> (as, I think, 'tis <hi>conſeſt</hi>) by ſuch as are Legiſlators, or Judges; the Account they muſt give at laſt to God, would be much more comfortable and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for them, than now it is like to be.</p>

                  <head>Of the Adoration, or Worſhip of Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>That our Lord Chriſt is to be <hi>worſhipped,</hi> was never made a Queſtion by the Unitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; we doubt not, that the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do worſhip him: the Queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the kind</hi> or <hi>ſort</hi> of Worſhip. Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians ſay, He is to be worſhipped as God: we ſay, He is to be worſhipp'd, as one (that I may uſe the Apoſtle's words) <hi>whom God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour;</hi> or as another Apoſtle ſpeaks, as one <hi>whom God hath given to be Head over all things to the Church,</hi> Acts 5.31. Epheſ. 1.22.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Worſhip; the firſt is <hi>Civil Honour or Worſhip;</hi> which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Others on account of Civil Dignity, or Natural Endowments, or the worthineſs of the Rational Nature common to us all. This kind of Worſhip is due more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Inferiors to Superiors; but is not to be neglected by Superiors to Inferiors. Next there is <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> which we give to others on account of their Holineſs, or of their Relation to God: And 'tis more or leſs, as their Sanctity or their Relation to God is greater or leſs; this ſort of Worſhip is due to holy Men and Women, to the Miniſters of God and holy Things, more yet to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, above them to glorified Spirits and Angels. We ſee in the Bible, that <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> was expreſs'd by Terms of great defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110211:30"/>and reſpect; ſuch as <hi>My Father,</hi> and <hi>My Lord;</hi> and for outward Acts, ſometimes by Kneeling, ſometimes by Proſtration, ſometimes other ways; as on the other hand, they were ſometimes accepted, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times refuſed. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> which belongs only to God. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Reſignation of our Underſtandings to what God ſhall ſay or reveal; a Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Wills and Deſires to what he does or decrees; 'tis a giving up our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to love him more than all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: It conſiſts moreover in ſuch exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts and Significations of Reverence and of Love towards him, as we reſerve only for him, and never give to any other.</p>
                  <p>I ſay now, the Texts cited and urged by our Oppoſer, do not prove, that the Lord Chriſt ought to be worſhipp'd with more than a <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Worſhip: there are no Acts of Worſhip ever required to be paid to him, but ſuch as may be paid to a <hi>Civil</hi> Power, to a Perſon in high Dignity and Office, or to Prophets and holy Men, or to ſuch as are actually poſſeſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Beatitudes. What if it is ſaid the Apoſtles <hi>worſhipped</hi> (that is, kneeled to) him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.17. and that to him every Knee both in Heaven and Earth <hi>ſhall bow? Phil.</hi> 2.11. Let our Oppoſers ſhow that the Apoſtles worſhipped him, not as their <hi>Maſter,</hi> but as their <hi>God;</hi> or that every Knee is to bow to him, not as to a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Lord, but as to a Perſon who is true and moſt High God: till they prove this, they prove nothing to the preſent purpoſe. We are well aſſured that we can prove the contrary; becauſe we can prove the Lord Chriſt was a <hi>Man,</hi> a Perſon who for his holy Life and Death was <hi>exaited by God,</hi> which is inconſiſtent with his being God, or a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God; and whatſoever <hi>Name</hi> he hath, that Name was <hi>gives to him</hi> by God; and whatſoever <hi>Worſhip</hi> is paid to him, is paid to him <hi>for the Sake, by the Command,</hi> and <hi>to the Glory</hi> (that I may uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words) <hi>of God, the Father of all;</hi> Phil. 2.11.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Satisfaction.</head>
               <p>AFter having proved, as he thinks, the Divinity of our Saviour, our Author undertakes to prove too the vulgar Doctrine of <hi>the Satisfaction.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>P.</hi> 683, 684. The Infinite Juſtice of God <hi>neceſſarily</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that every <hi>Sinner,</hi> nay, that every <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> be puniſh'd. Therefore, ſaith he farther, that Mankind is pardoned, is <hi>an Effect of the Juſtice of God;</hi> to which Juſtice a full Satisfaction being paid, by the Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt in our ſtead; God could not evidence his Juſtice otherways than by granting Pardon and Salvation to us. If God could pardon us freely, without a Satisfaction to his Juſtice, why are not the fallen Angels pardoned?</p>
               <p>At <hi>P.</hi> 706. he has contrived a Tale, or Romance, concerning a certain King, who taking Pity of his Rebels, declared that they ſhould be pardoned, if any Perſon would be ſo kind to them, as to ſuffer in their ſtead: He tells us, the King's only Son offered to ſuffer for them; and his Offer being accepted by his Father, <hi>who dearly loved him,</hi> the Son died, and the Rebels were ſaved. And this, he ſaith, is exactly our caſe with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:110211:30"/>He pretends alſo to anſwer to ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made by the Socinians, againſt <hi>the</hi> (pretended) <hi>Satisfaction to God's Juſtice by the Lord Chriſt for our Sins.</hi> They object, that the Doctrine of a full Satisfaction to God's Juſtice on our behalf, deſtroys the <hi>free Grace</hi> of God (ſo much magnified in holy Scripture) in the <hi>gratuitous</hi> Pardon of our Sins: for if God received an <hi>Equivalent</hi> on our behalf, he hath not <hi>pardoned</hi> us, but only diſcharged or acquitted us, becauſe our Debt to his Juſtice has been paid for us by another. To this he anſwers, Yes, the Grace and Pardon of God to us was moſt free: becauſe tho our Debt to God's Juſtice has been paid, yet <hi>not by us,</hi> but by a Perſon whom God himſelf found out for us. Beſides, the Satisfaction made for us by the Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt, being <hi>a refuſable Payment,</hi> becauſe God might have required the Satisfaction of our ſelves, or <hi>from us;</hi> therefore he is rightly ſaid to have <hi>pardoned</hi> us, and to have ſhown moſt <hi>free</hi> Grace and Favour to us, even tho an Equivalent, and Satisfaction was made to his Juſtice on our behalf.</p>
               <p>Again; They object, that God could not in Juſtice ſubſtitute a moſt <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Perſon to undergo <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, in the place and ſtead of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous</hi> and <hi>worthleſs</hi> Perſons; <hi>that</hi> were to pervert the Nature and whole Deſign of that ſort of Juſtice which is exerciſed about Rewards and Puniſhments. He anſwers, God might puniſh the Lord Chriſt for us; Firſt, Becauſe under <hi>the Law</hi> the <hi>innocent</hi> Beaſt was ſubſtituted to Death and Puniſhment, by being made a Sacrifice for the Sin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the offending Owner and Maſter: <hi>then,</hi> becauſe the Lord Chriſt freely offered himſelf to ſuffer in our room and ſtead.</p>
               <p>Farther, they object, that the <hi>three days Death</hi> of the Lord Chriſt cannot be <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and therefore not a Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God for <hi>the eternal Death</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> of one Sinner, much leſs of all Mankind. For, ſuppoſing that the Value of Sufferings or Puniſhment is increaſed even to Infinity, by the infinite Dignity of the Perſon that ſuffers; and ſuppoſing again, that the Lord Chriſt being God as well as Man, was indeed a Perſon of Infinite Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet ſeeing his Divinity could ſuffer nothing at all, but only his Humanity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>his Sufferings were but human and finite,</hi> and conſequently no way commenſurate to the <hi>infinite</hi> Puniſhment due to <hi>one</hi> Sinner, much leſs to that of <hi>all</hi> Sinners. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that to the account of the Sufferings or Puniſhment of the Lord Chriſt, we muſt reckon all the Sufferings of his Life, and eſpecially his Agony in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; which (our Author ſaith) was ſo great, that it was equivalent to that eternal Puniſhment prepared by God for all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners, <hi>p.</hi> 749.</p>
               <p>But leſt the Agony in the Garden and on the Croſs, ſhould ſeem to any, to have been too much ſhort in time, to be laid in the Ballance againſt the eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Mankind: Therefore he ſubjoins. 2. As our Sins are made infinite, by their being committed againſt the Infinite Majeſty of God: So the Satisfaction of the Lord Chriſt for us by his Death and other Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments was alſo Infinite, <hi>on the account of God's Greatneſs to which that Satisfaction was made,</hi> p. 662. That is, the Puniſhment of the Lord Chriſt was Infinite, becauſe he offered it to an Infinite God. He adds in the ſame place, God would never have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ours, if he had not certainly known, that they were equivalent to the Puniſhments due to us for Sin. 3. The Perſon that ſuffered for us was both God and Man, and thereby his Sufferings were of an Infinite Value, and ſo equivalent to the Infinite Puniſhment due to us: for <hi>tho the true God could neither die nor ſuffer; yet he who was true God did both ſuffer and die,</hi> p. 663.</p>
               <p>And becauſe he underſtands not the true ſtate of the Queſtion and Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Unitarians and the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Satisfaction by our Saviour; he hath objected to us a great number of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110211:31"/>Texts, which are no way contrary to our Doctrine. He tells us from holy Scripture, that the Lord Chriſt was <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, was bruiſed for our Iniquities;</hi> that <hi>we are healed by his Stripes;</hi> that <hi>God hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all;</hi> that <hi>he made his Soul an Offering for Sin;</hi> that <hi>he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for our Offences;</hi> that <hi>he bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</hi> or Croſs. To theſe he adds, Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation for eur Sins;</hi> — <hi>to declare his</hi> (God's) <hi>Righteouſneſs, that he may be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth on Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, is the Sum and Force of what our Author hath diſcourſed at large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Satisfaction.</hi> He is ſo well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Truth of his Doctrine, that he ends his Book with twice imprecating on himſelf a Curſe, if he ſhall ever write or teach other ways than he has taught his Reader in this preſent Book.</p>
               <p>I will take a ſhort view of all that he hath ſaid.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, firſt; The Infinite Juſtice of God requires, that every Sinner, nay, that every Tranſgreſſion be puniſhed; and that when God <hi>pardons</hi> and <hi>ſaves</hi> Sinners, this is <hi>an Act of his Juſtice;</hi> to which Juſtice a full Satisfaction having been paid by the Lord Chriſt, God cannot be juſt other ways than by pardoning and ſaving us. And if God can pardon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without a Satisfaction to his Juſtice, why are not the Devils forgiven?</p>
               <p>This was argued like <hi>a Novice</hi> in theſe Queſtions: the more Learned of his own Party know that the Cauſe is loſt, if in the Queſtion of the Satisfaction, Almighty God be not conſidered <hi>as a Governour,</hi> who indeed <hi>can</hi> forgive the Offenders, but for <hi>Prudential</hi> Reaſons he <hi>will not</hi> forgive without a Satisfaction to his Honour and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Our Author ſtands in it, that God cannot forgive any Offender, or Offence, without Satisfaction by the Offender himſelf, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his ſtead. Why, what is the reaſon that the King and Proprietor of the whole World cannot forgive? He anſwers, <hi>'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Juſtice.</hi> But is it contrary to Juſtice to ſhow Mercy, or to remit of my own Rights and Dues? Am I unjuſt if I do not exact the <hi>whole</hi> of what is due to me? I may certainly do what I will with my own, elſe 'tis not <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> my own. He that cannot <hi>forgive,</hi> neither can he <hi>give;</hi> for Forgiveneſs is nothing elſe, but <hi>giving my Right</hi> (to Debt or Puniſhment) to the Perſon who is indebted, or has offended me. 'Tis contrary (he ſaith) to the Juſtice of God, to forgive either the Tranſgreſſion, or the Tranſgreſſor: but if it be contrary to Juſtice, 'tis <hi>eſſentially and morally evil:</hi> I ask therefore, How can God command us to forgive to one another our Tranſgreſſions and Offences? Can God command us what is morally and eſſentially evil, or what is contrary to the eternal Laws of Juſtice, by which he himſelf is obliged? O mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Scheme of Juſtice! 'tis contrary (they ſay) to Juſtice, to pardon without a full Satisfaction; but not contrary to Juſtice to lay my Guilt, and the Puniſhment due to it, on a Perſon <hi>wholly</hi> innocent and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> righteous: 'tis unjuſt to <hi>forgive</hi> the <hi>real</hi> Offender, or to <hi>abate</hi> of the Puniſhment due to him; but not unjuſt to ſubſtitute <hi>a well-deſerving</hi> Perſon to the Puniſhment that belonged to the other. In a word, <hi>to ſhow Mercy</hi> by pardoning Offences is Unjuſtice; but to <hi>miſplace Puniſhment</hi> is none at all, but worthy of the Holineſs and of the Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>But he faith, if God can forgive without an Equivalent, or Satisfaction to his Juſtice by the Offender, or another for him, why are not the Devils forgiven? And I ask, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infinite Satisfaction hath been made in the Opinion of our Author and his Party, for Sinners, why are not the Devils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in it? The ſame Infinite Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which our Oppoſers teach, was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough for the fallen Angels as well as for Men: let them tell us, how ſo much precious <hi>Merit</hi> comes to be loſt? This
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110211:31"/>Queſtion can never be anſwered on the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of our Oppoſers; but on the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Hypotheſis there is no difficulty at all in the caſe of the fallen Angels; for we anſwer, they are not forgiven, <hi>becauſe they repent not, nor amend.</hi> Almighty God, as King and Proprietor of all Perſons and Things, can forgive any Offence, or all Offences, even without Repentance or Amendment; nor is it contrary to his Juſtice ſo to do: but 'tis inconſiſtent with his Wiſdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to forgive without Repentance or Amendment, is to incourage Sin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the World: 'Tis alſo contrary to the Holineſs of God, that the Incorrigible and Impenitent ſhould eſcape unpuniſh'd. Our Oppoſers miſtake too in thinking that 'tis the Juſtice of God by which he is prompted to puniſh Sinners; 'tis his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom: Juſtice has no other ſhare or intereſt in Puniſhment, but only to ſee that Puniſhment be <hi>not miſplaced,</hi> and that it do <hi>not exceed the Offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his Tale about the (mad) old King, and his (fooliſh) Son, 'tis perfectly ridiculous. He hath imagined, a King that promiſes to pardon his Rebels, if any other will be ſo kind as to ſuffer for them. 'Tis a <hi>mad</hi> Propoſition, in the higheſt degree unreaſonable and unjuſt; becauſe if it was neceſſary that their Offences ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd; Juſtice and Reaſon require, that the Offenders themſelves, and not an innocent Perſon or Perſons ſhould ſuffer. Well, but as mad as the old King was, his Son was as fooliſh; for (our Author aſſures us) the Son offered to ſave the Rebels by dying in their ſtead: nor did the Folly of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son ſtop here; for when the Father heard his Son ſay that he would die for the Rebels, he approved his Son's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, put his Son to Death, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his Rebels. Nor does our Author forbear to publiſh his own proper Folly, by telling us, that the old King <hi>dearly loved his Son,</hi> tho he put him to Death <hi>for other Mens Faults:</hi> He adds, that <hi>this is our very caſe,</hi> with reſpect to God Almighty and the Lord. Chriſt. 'Tis ſo, I acknowledg, in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of our Oppoſers; but let them ſee to it, whether they do not expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to juſt Scorn; while they can no ways defend their Hypotheſis of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but by comparing Almighty God and our Lord Chriſt to two ſuch Prodigies of Folly, as never <hi>really</hi> were (or could be) <hi>in Nature,</hi> but only in the <hi>Fiction</hi> and <hi>Fancy</hi> of the Poetaſter of <hi>Yarmouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I demand, would our Poet himſelf, as odd-conceited as he is, put his Son to death, or conſent that he ſhould be put to Death, to ſave his Maligners and Adverſaries from a Puniſhment highly due to their Crimes? He hath been a great Enemy in his time to Rebellion, and at this day is writing Books againſt Rebels who are dead forty Years ago: Would he give one of his Children to Death, to ſave any of the ſurviving Rebels, as ſuppoſe Friend <hi>Ludlow?</hi> If he is neither ſo ſilly, nor ſo wicked to his Child, how has he dared to ſay, this is our caſe with reſpect to Almighty God and the Lord Chriſt? Why did not the Compariſon and Inſtance that he himſelf deviſed, open his Eyes to diſcern the Folly and Inconſiſtency of his Doctrine?</p>
               <p>The Socinians object to their Oppoſers in theſe Queſtions, That if <hi>an Equivalent</hi> (which Trinitarians call <hi>a Satisfaction</hi>) has been given to God's Juſtice, on our behalf, by the Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt, then God hath not truly <hi>pardoned</hi> us, which the Scriptures every where affirm, but only <hi>diſcharged</hi> and <hi>acquitted</hi> us, becauſe (our Debt being paid) he could do no leſs.</p>
               <p>Our Author anſwers; Tho God's Juſtice has been ſatisfied, yet it was who found out the Perſon, who was able and willing to pay our Debt: Beſides, the Sufferings of our Lord Chriſt, tho they were <hi>equivalent</hi> to the Puniſhment due to Sinners, were <hi>a refuſable Payment;</hi> for God might have required, that the Sinners ſhould ſuffer in their own Perſons, not in the Perſon of a Redeemer, Mediator or Undertaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:110211:32"/>I will be ſo liberal, as to grant to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor both theſe Anſwers; but I muſt inſiſt upon it, that they are no Anſwers to the Objection propoſed. For God doth not pardon his Debt or Offence, becauſe he finds out a third Perſon that will pay or ſuffer for the Debtor or Offender; theſe two differ juſt as much as Payment and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that is to ſay, they are Contraries. But our Author adds, the Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt were <hi>a refuſable Payment:</hi> 'tis well, but he ſaith, they were <hi>an equivalent Payment;</hi> how then can God be ſaid to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> us? doth <hi>He</hi> forgive who receives <hi>an Equivalent</hi> to the Debt due to him? Yes, he ſaith, it is Forgiveneſs <hi>with reſpect to us,</hi> for we have paid nothing, whatever our Friend, whom God found out, hath paid for us. But why doth he not conſider that the Scriptures not only ſay, that <hi>Sinners are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi> but they ſay, <hi>God hath pardoned them?</hi> You may call their <hi>Diſcharge</hi> a <hi>Pardon,</hi> with reſpect to them; but you can never ſay, <hi>God hath pardoned them,</hi> if they are only <hi>diſcharged</hi> upon <hi>an Equivalent</hi> given for them, or paid by another on their behalf. To ſay, God hath pardoned us, ſuppoſes that he has received no Equivalent on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; for if he had, however <hi>we might be ſaid to be pardoned,</hi> yet it could not be ſaid that <hi>God pardoned us;</hi> for the Pardon muſt (in that caſe) be imputed to the Perſon or Perſons, who made the Satisfaction or the Equivalent, not to God. To avoid this, our Oppoſers ſay, he that made the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, was God: the Son of God, who is alſo himſelf true God, that very true God to whom the Satisfaction was made, he made for us the Satisfaction. But this is <hi>Jargon,</hi> and we expected Reaſon from them: The one true God, they ſay, made for us the Satisfaction to the one true God; we deny that 'tis <hi>Senſe,</hi> or <hi>intelligible.</hi> There is but one true God, and he is to <hi>receive the Satisfaction</hi> for our Sins againſt his Infinite Majeſty, and not to <hi>give Satisfaction:</hi> How then can they ſay, but that they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſay any thing, the one true God made for us the Satisfaction? And if it could be true what they ſay, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf paid for us the Equivalent or Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this is indeed no other but <hi>forgiving us without a Satisfaction,</hi> which is the very thing they deny: For if I pay to my ſelf the Debt of my Debtor, or undergo the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Offender; this is but <hi>a mock-Satisfaction,</hi> and I indeed <hi>forgive him without a Satisfaction.</hi> Which is ſo plain, that I wonder that ſo many Learned Perſons as have written on the one and the other ſide of this Queſtion, have not obſerved it.</p>
               <p>Another Objection of the Socinians againſt the (pretended) <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is; God could not (juſtly or wiſely) ſubſtitute an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and well-deſerving Perſon, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Puniſhment, <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, in the place and ſtead of the Unrighteous and Worthleſs; becauſe 'tis of the Nature of Juſtice, not to miſplace Puniſhment. Our Author's Anſwers are; The <hi>Innocent</hi> Beaſt was ſacrificed for the Sin of the Owner; and the Lord Chriſt <hi>freely offer'd himſelf</hi> to ſuffer for us, though we were Worthleſs and Wicked.</p>
               <p>His inſtance of Beaſts offer'd in Sacrifice, on occaſion of the Sin of their Owners, is not a whit to the purpoſe; for the Owners having an <hi>abſolute</hi> Dominion over, and a <hi>compleat</hi> Right to the Service, Uſe, and very <hi>Life</hi> of their Beaſts; therefore it was no Unjuſtice, when the Life of the Beaſt was given for the Offence of the Maſter or Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Owner might kill his Beaſt for Food; therefore much more might he offer him to God, in lieu and exchange of his own Life, forfeited to God by Sin. And in this caſe, the <hi>Worthleſs</hi> was offer'd to the Mercy and gracious Acceptance of God, for the <hi>Worthy:</hi> ſo that there was no Offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, either againſt <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> But all things are contrary, in the Lord Chriſt and Us, eſpecially in the Hypotheſis of our Oppoſers; for he was a Perſon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, of <hi>Infinite</hi> Dignity and Merit; and we had no <hi>right</hi> in him, or <hi>dominion</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110211:32"/>him, as the Sacrificer had over his Beaſt, that we ſhould offer his Life or his Sufferings to God inſtead of our own.</p>
               <p>As to that, the Lord Chriſt <hi>freely offer'd himſelf for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> to undergo <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to us: Neither could he do it, nor could God accept of it or allow it. An Innocent and Righteous Perſon may not, an Holy and Juſt Judg muſt not pervert the due Courſe of Juſtice. A juſt Governor may pardon Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, of his Mercy, but he cannot inflict their Puniſhment on the Innocent and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; for 'tis of the very Eſſence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nay, is the firſt thing belonging to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not to miſplace Puniſhment. Not to miſplace Puniſhment, and not to exceed the deſert of the Offence, are the two things that conſtitute the Nature of <hi>Punitive</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>The laſt Objection, of which our Author thinks fit to take notice, is this; That the Three-days Death, and other Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt, could not be equivalent to the Eternal Damnation of ſo much as one Man, much leſs of all Mankind. He anſwers <hi>three</hi> ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Saviour's <hi>Agony</hi> in the Garden was, without doubt, ſuch a weight of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Pain, as was <hi>equivalent</hi> even to the <hi>eternal</hi> Damnation of <hi>all</hi> Men; elſe we muſt ſay, He was far leſs valiant in ſuffering, than many Martyrs have been; nay, was a very Daſtard and Coward. Our Author purſues this Calumny upon his Saviour in ſeveral Pages; ſee (Reader) from <hi>p.</hi> 739, to <hi>p.</hi> 749.</p>
               <p>He makes <hi>Calanus</hi> the Indian (not a Chriſtian neither, but an Heathen) a very <hi>Herot,</hi> in compariſon of that poor diſpirited pretender Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> He hath this Paſſage, at <hi>p.</hi> 739. <q>Nothing ſeems more <hi>mean,</hi> among the various Accounts of Sufferers for Truth, than the Carriage of our Saviour.</q> He ſaith farther, That our Saviour prayed moſt earneſtly to be delivered from Death; and that he ſweat Drops, like Drops of Blood; but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs even offer'd themſelves to the moſt cruel Deaths, and <hi>ſang</hi> in the midſt of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the great Paſſion of our Saviour in the Garden, has made many to think, not without cauſe, that it proceeded from ſome higher Reaſon, than the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Death of the Croſs, which He was ſhortly to undergo. It may be (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probably) ſuppoſed, that He conflicted <hi>then</hi> with great Temprations; that the Devil was very buſy to fill his Mind with <hi>horrid</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's and Repreſentations; and that this was the Cauſe of his <hi>Agony,</hi> and that <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was ſent to ſtrengthen him.</hi> The Martyrs (on the contrary) had influences and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances from the Divine Spirit; and the Tempter was with-held from venting his Malice on them.</p>
               <p>But to ſuppoſe, with our preſent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that our Saviour underwent (in the Garden) the very Torments of Hell; nay, ſuch Torments as are infinitely greater than Hell-Torments; becauſe they were equivalent to <hi>the eternal</hi> Torments of <hi>all</hi> the Damned; this is ſaid without any ground, nay, contrary to all good Reaſon. We muſt ſuppoſe, on our Author's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, Firſt, That Chriſt underwent in the ſpace of an hour, ſuch an acute Pain, as anſwers fully to the whole Pain of a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Perſon in all <hi>Eternity.</hi> Secondly, That this Pain was ſo multiplied, as to be equal to <hi>all</hi> the Tortures of <hi>all</hi> the Damned in <hi>whole</hi> Eternity: And yet, Thirdly, he was only <hi>exceeding ſorrowful,</hi> and had a very great <hi>Sweat:</hi> Surely ſuch a Pain would have made him to <hi>cry out,</hi> much more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly than on the Croſs; and how could an Angel <hi>ſtrengthen him</hi> under ſuch a Pain, of which no Angel in Heaven could him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have bore the <hi>thouſandth</hi> part?</p>
               <p>But I would know too, why an Angel from Heaven ſhould be ſent to <hi>ſtrengthen him,</hi> as is expreſly ſaid at <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43? Why not rather the Divine Perſon, which (our Oppoſers ſay) was in him, and with which he was perſonally united, and perſonally one? It had been far more natural, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110211:33"/>his own Divinity ſhould have <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> his Humanity, than that the Angel ſhall be ſent to ſupport <hi>that</hi> Man, who was (they ſay) God-Man. I know not what Reliſhes other Mens Underſtandings may have, but it will never go down with me, that <hi>God-Man</hi> could want to be ſtrengthned by an <hi>Angel;</hi> and I look upon this to be an unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument, that our Lord Chriſt was only a Prophet, and not God, or any ſuch ſuper-eminent Spirit, as the Arians believe him to be.</p>
               <p>But that our Saviour's Sufferings may not want <hi>Weight,</hi> to be laid in the Ballance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>all</hi> the Sufferings of <hi>all</hi> the Damned, our Author ſaith, 2. As the Guilt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of Sin is made Infinite, by being committed againſt the Infinite Majeſty of God; ſo the Merit of Chriſt's Sufferings on our behalf becomes Infinite too, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered to an Infinite God.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, when I read this, and his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the old King and his Son, I gave our Author over: for there never was any Man ſo ſilly but this Author, as to conceit, that a thing is made better or greater by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Excellence of the Perſon to whom 'tis oftered; tho it be true that an Offence may be the greater, for ſome Qualifications of the Perſon againſt whom it is done.</p>
               <p>If what he ſays were true, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of God makes that Suffering which is preſented to him to be alſo Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; what needed our Saviour to have undergone ſo much as our Author conceits; the Pain of the Croſs: nay, the leaſt Pain in his Finger had been ſufficient, without the <hi>horrible</hi> Agony in the Garden, which he ſuppoſes to have been equal to <hi>all</hi> the Pains of <hi>all</hi> the Damned, and that for ever. And if it be true, that Chriſt's Sufferings are made Infinite, by <hi>his</hi> Infinity to whom they are offered, then ſo alſo would the Sufferings of any other Man. This ſtrange reaſoning of our Author, makes the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt to be wholly needleſs; the Sinners themſelves might have <hi>ſully ſatisfied God's Juſtice,</hi> and that too by <hi>the ſlighteſt</hi> Sufferings, if ſuffering receives its nature and degree from the Infinity of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to whom 'tis tendred.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, thirdly, He that ſuffered for us was God and Man in one Perſon: and tho ('tis true) <hi>the true God could not die or ſuffer; yet He who was true God, did both ſuffer and die.</hi> The Sufferings of ſuch a Perſon muſt needs be eſteemed of <hi>Infinite Value,</hi> tho they were not Infinite in their <hi>Intenſion,</hi> or in their <hi>Duration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In think this to be almoſt as weak as the former Anſwer. For ſeeing they dare not pretend, that <hi>God</hi> could ſuffer any thing, but only <hi>the Humanity,</hi> which (They ſay) was united to him; ſuch Sufferings were but <hi>Human Sufferings,</hi> the Sufferings of a Man, not of God, and therefore in no ſenſe <hi>Infinite.</hi> Their Conceit, that <hi>the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> of Chriſts is united to <hi>the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the Son, helps them not in this caſe; for God dwells in all the Faithful, nay, is <hi>united</hi> to them, and <hi>one with them;</hi> they are ſo <hi>joined</hi> (that I may uſe the Apoſtle's words) <hi>to the Lord, as to be one Spirit with him;</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. John 17.21. but neither their <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> nor their <hi>Sufferings</hi> have any more value on that account, but are rated only according to their intrinſick, proper and real Worth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>On the</hi> Texts <hi>alledged for</hi> the Satisfaction; <hi>with a</hi> Concluſion <hi>of the whole.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE laſt thing we are to conſider, is the Collection of Texts that our Author has here made; he urges, Firſt, That <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, was bruiſed for our Iniquities;</hi> that <hi>we are healed by his Stripes;</hi> that <hi>God hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all;</hi> that <hi>He hath made his Soul an Offering for Sin.</hi> All this is taken out of the 53d Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is by <hi>ſome</hi> taken to be a Prophecy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> by <hi>others,</hi> concerning the Meſſiah, or Chriſt. I do not think it to be any Prophecy at all, except in ſome few Paſſages of it; but eſpecially not a Prophecy concerning a Perſon who was <hi>then</hi> to be born: I conceive the words are to be underſtood of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> himſelf, who ſpeaking of himſelf, modeſtly ſpeaks in the third Perſon, and the ſenſe begins at <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>I wonder very much, that ſo many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men as have commented on this Prophet, have not diſcerned that the whole Diſcourſe perfectly ſutes to the Prophet himſelf, and that he ſpeaks of a Perſon <hi>actually in being,</hi> not of one who was yet to be born. But becauſe it would take up a great deal of room to make a Paraphraſe on the <hi>two</hi> Chapters, and to ſhow <hi>the Reaſon</hi> of it; I will be content to ſet down the Explication by <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> of the particular Expreſſions here objected by our Author. <hi>Grotius</hi> is of opinion, that from <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſies of the Sufferings of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> yet ſo, that the whole Prophecy, and all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the 53d Chapter, had <hi>a ſecond Completion</hi> in the Perſon, Actions and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord Chriſt: and therefore ſome of the Expreſſions, tho originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> are by the Writers of the New Teſtament <hi>accommodated</hi> alſo, and applied to the Lord Chriſt. Let us ſee what he ſaith.</p>
               <p>Iſa. 53.5. <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and was bruiſed for our Iniquities.</hi> But in the Original 'tis, he <hi>has</hi> been wounded <hi>by</hi> our Wickedneſs, and bruiſed <hi>by</hi> our Iniquity; that is, we have wickedly and unjuſtly afflicted and perſecuted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him; and by his Stripes we are healed.</hi> No, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſaith, <hi>The Reproofs of our Peace were with him:</hi> that is, the Reproofs that would have made our Peace with God, if we had hearkned to them, were truly with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; he reproved us juſtly, and for our ſaving Good, if we would have hearkned: <hi>and by thoſe his Stripes we might have been healed, i. e.</hi> by thoſe ſharp and home-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, by thoſe <hi>Stripes</hi> of his Mouth, we might have been amended and reformed, and thereby reconciled to God, and healed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>All we, like Sheep, have gone aſtray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> In the Hebrew, the Lord hath <hi>by</hi> him <hi>met with</hi> the Iniquity of us all: <hi>q. d.</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved all our Wickedneſs by him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for Sin, he ſhall ſee his Seed, he ſhall prolong his days.</hi> But in the Hebrew thus; <hi>If he</hi> (the Prophet) <hi>ſhall ſubmit his Soul to Puniſhment,</hi> he ſhall ſee his Seed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110211:34"/>his days: or, <hi>Tho he ſubmit his Soul to Puniſhment,</hi> &amp;c. Puniſhment, ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> here, is <hi>properly</hi> for Sin; but the Hebrews (ſaith he) call all Affliction by or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, tho unjuſt and underſerved, by the Name of Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>But our Author objects again, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>was delivered for our Offences.</hi> And 1 Pet 2.24. <hi>Who himſelf bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</hi> or Croſs. Rom. 3.24. <hi>Him hath God ſet forth to be a Propitiation for our Sins, to declare his</hi> (God's) <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Heb. 9.26. <hi>Now once in the end of the World he hath appeared, to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis to be noted, that very few of thoſe that have undertaken to write againſt us, have really underſtood what we affirm or deny, concerning <hi>the Cauſes,</hi> or <hi>the Effects</hi> of our Saviour's Death. They trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves with citing a great many Texts to evince that 'twas for our Sins <hi>(as one Cauſe)</hi> that Chriſt died; that he was a Sacrifice and Oblation for the Sins of the World; that he was a Ranſom, a Price of Redemption for us. We deny none of theſe things, taken in a ſober and poſſible ſenſe: the Queſtion is only this, Whether the Lord Chriſt <hi>offered himſelf</hi> as <hi>ſuch</hi> a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Oblation or Price as might be made <hi>to the Juſtice of God,</hi> by way of <hi>Equivalent</hi> for what we ſhould have ſuffered; or was an Oblation and Application, as all former Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law were, <hi>to the Mercy of God,</hi> by way of humble ſuit and depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? We affirm the latter of theſe, that the Lord Chriſt, <hi>beſides other Ends of his Death,</hi> tendred himſelf (in the nature of a Sacrifice) on the Altar of the Croſs, to the Mercy and Benignity of God, by way of Supplication; not to the Divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as an <hi>Equivalent</hi> for ſo great a Debt as the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Puniſhment of all Mankind in Hell-Fire. We judg it better thus to ſpeak, than as our Oppoſers do, becauſe the Abolition of our Sins, and our Diſcharge from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is always in Holy Scripture attributed to the great Mercy and Goodneſs of God; 'tis called Pardon, Remiſſion, Grace, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Grace, Riches of Grace; all which were falſe, if indeed the Lord Chriſt gave a juſt <hi>Equivalent</hi> (they ſay, <hi>more than an Equivalent</hi>) to God's Juſtice for us.</p>
               <p>In a word, our Oppoſers and We <hi>agree,</hi> that the Lord Chriſt, <hi>being to die upon other accounts,</hi> did withal tender his Perſon in Quality of an Expiatory Sacrifice, for the Sins of Mankind; himſelf was the Offerer, and alſo the Victim, and his Croſs the Altar; he was a Ranſom, and a Price of Redemption for us: but in this we differ, Whether he was an <hi>Adequate</hi> Price, or a Sacrifice <hi>to the Juſtice of God?</hi> We cannot comprehend that <hi>one</hi> Man could be an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> for <hi>all</hi> Men; or his <hi>ſhort</hi> Sufferings <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>Eternal</hi> Damnation of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Multitude; or that God can be ſaid to <hi>pardon,</hi> if he hath been <hi>over-paid</hi> for our Debt to him: therefore we content our ſelves to teach, that our Bleſſed Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confirm his Goſpel by his Death, and to be <hi>made perfect by Sufferings,</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the Hebrews ſpeaks, did alſo offer himſelf as a Sacrifice, and as a ſort of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and Price for us, to <hi>that</hi> Mercy and Benignity of God, by which he was wont to accept the Oblation of Beaſts, the Blood of Goats and Lambs, for his repenting and returning People. This Hypotheſis leaves to God the intire Glory of forgiving us; to our Saviour, the Honour of being the Means, Motive and Procurer of our Pardon and Salvation; and fully anſwers all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Expreſſions concerning our Saviour's Death, objected to us by our Oppoſers in this Queſtion. But <hi>they</hi> (our Oppoſers) after all their Subterfuges, are forced by their Hypotheſis, to this <hi>monſtrous</hi> Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that God <hi>freely</hi> pardoneth to Sinners their whole <hi>Debt</hi> of Sin and Puniſhment; and yet has been infinitely <hi>over-paid</hi> for both, in the Death and other Sufferings of the Lord Chriſt: than which, there can be no greater, or more apparent Contradiction.</p>
               <p>As to our Author's Concluſion, that he wiſhes himſelf <hi>accurſed,</hi> and <hi>again accurſed,</hi> if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110211:34"/>ever he deliver other Doctrine than what he hath defended in this Book: I ſhall only ſay this, that <hi>as wiſe as he have lived to alter their Minds.</hi> Nor can he defend his Raſhneſs by the Example of the Apoſtle; for when St. <hi>Paul</hi> curſes <hi>himſelf</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> for preaching or teaching otherways, he ſpeaks not of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uncertain Queſtions; but <hi>If we preach any other GOSPEL to you, let us be accurſed; Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. And the reaſon of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Confidence was very different from our Author's: the latter grounds himſelf on a few ambiguous and uncertain Texts, capable of <hi>contrary</hi> Tranſlations and Senſes; and when taken in <hi>his</hi> Senſe of them, are contrary to Reaſon and common Senſe, and to the general Current of Holy Scripture: but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a matter which he had received by <hi>expreſs</hi> Revelation from Jeſus Chriſt, and even from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of All.</p>
